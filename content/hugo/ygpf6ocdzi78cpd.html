      <p>I remember on some jaobin ns someone was talking about theliv like they had
inside info. they talked about not having a normal training system and how it
mostly recruit for other companies now. There was a whole bunch of redacted
stuff after op asked for more info but they kept saying that guy wasnâ€™t a
trainee</p>

      <p>i have no inside info or anything like that but if you noticed or kept up with
a1lee and whee1ns cases, that company didn't drag their asses to court (most
do). the girls wanted to leave so they did. whee1n fans are mad at the current
ceo and whee1n herself is kinda petty about the company keeping the youtube
channels they opened for her youtube content but in my eyes that's completely
normal. it's not like they kept her personal ig account or anything. their
contract is probably very lose, not as tight/strict since rav1 was an idol and
has voiced out how he dislikes the system</p>
