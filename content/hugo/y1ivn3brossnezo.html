      <p>not sure if you want to talk about an update account here but I need to tell ab
this somewhere ignore me if you want 😭 I got secondhand embarrassment whenever
I see won tweaking over mttys body it's not just simple 'horny' two tweets like
others, she will talk about it for one hour and post the same pics a lot 😭 even
when a bit of his skin was exposed, she will talk about that and whenever his
tattoos were shown she would gagged over it like it was the first time she saw
it like girl calm down I like mtty too but he's still a man it's embarrassing to
go that far thirsting over him 💀 need other skrs to step up and be an update
acc as consistent as her okay I'm done 😁</p>
