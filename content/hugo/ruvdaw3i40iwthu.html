      <p>Oh sponsoring perfumes for his bday cafe is cool, also I think the perfume bday
cafe was a cool ideas. That’s the thing with smaller brands is if they work well
with you it can rally be a good tie, like hapa kristen? The contacts brand, they
were built up to what they are now through w0ny and she’s practically the face
of their brand and it was a gamble since they were a much smaller brand when she
started working with them but long term it’s been such a good partnership for
both parties</p>
