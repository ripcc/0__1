      <p>iirc jao once mentioned in an interview that he decided to sign with them bc
they promised that they'd debut him but they ended up putting him a bplanet so i
guess it makes sense that his contract is shorter than the rest?</p>

      <p><p>a promise is diff than on paper but idk I doubt that they&apos;d make him sign anything less than 5-6 yrs even if that was the case</p></p>

      <p>i'm lowkey not sure why everyone's doubting this because it really is common
knowledge if you kick it with crosins especially the hardcore ones lmao his
contract isn't even an artist contract it's like 3 years i think</p>
