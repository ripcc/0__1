      <p>that (like especially all the ones that sound like sexual harassment when they
could just say they find the idol hot) and the amount of rude, trolly shit like
these stupid en- stans who clog up every kpop groups comment section or
yesterday how i saw a tiktok of ka1 on 3xo's page and someone said that ka1
should join m00nbin like it's just nasty stuff on there.... i know the tiktok
comment section likes to make controversial comments that get replied to a lot
appear higher but it's so NASTY</p>
