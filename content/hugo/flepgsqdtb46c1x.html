      <p>I mean ppl who could be the biggest problems (mostly bgs) like enpen peend riice
17 stray children are not cbing in july and gg digimons with good fanbases like
aspa and bp aren't either (hopefully) so july seems better than june at least
now I'm just hoping it's not at the same week as 2wice or xtx or god forbid bt$
I'll end my life</p>
