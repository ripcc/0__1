      <p>as someone who gets a heart attack anytime rumors like these get brought up i
went on TikTok to see whatever ppl were saying about hb‚Äôs girlfriend and barely
found 2 posts about some girl that looked more like his sister‚Äôs friend that
anything and obviously very weird cropped ‚Äúproof‚Äù so y‚Äôall made me paranoid for
no reason</p>

      <p>I can assure you if there's really substance to any hanbin/hao dating rumours
that isn't each other rosins/allins will blast it full volume from every rooftop
and every socmed account they can get their hands and feet on. This K.O.s both
each other akgaes and the Haobinists without hurting their own Stan and may even
help. So if it's not being blasted there's no real substance there.</p>
