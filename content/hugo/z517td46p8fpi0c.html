      <p>it depends what u consider content tbh because if it's official schedules sure
(2 this year + tingle) but if its tiktoks/vlogs/whatever it's probably mttbn or
mttprkz?</p>

      <p>Well I mean anon thatâ€™s just shows how they arenâ€™t banned because why would wki
let them go on yt shows and contents and promote themselves officially as a duo
but stop them from doing silly little tiktoks on the groups account ðŸ˜­ its more
likely the case if they just post with whoever they want or talk to about
specific challanges</p>
