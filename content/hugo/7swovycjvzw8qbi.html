      <p>so dk if you care abt wswf but some koreans are saying they like 2 as mc but
intl side says he's lacking as mc because he doesn't hype up the battles and
don't tell the dancers to like back off when they get too close or break a rule
(?) i think which k$ng dan1el used to do and maybe its because the dancers are
like his seniors and he's a bit shy or hesitant but yeah they're basically
saying this is why you shouldn't use junior mc's lmaoo and that they miss dan1el
but like yk he's also in the military sooo i'm sure if it wasn't for that yeah
they prob would have kept him</p>
