      <p>rkys vocal range is crazy and hes pretty good at imitating stuff and im so proud
of myself he aint even my bias but i was one of the few anons who guessed rky
when that clip dropped, i think he just needs confidence with live singing and
practice stability and he'll be a godly live performer</p>
