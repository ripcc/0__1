      <p>It‚Äôs not a recent thing I think anon is only noticing it now lol they‚Äôve been
pushing them HARDDD since like melpo era üò≠



You know companies nowadays have a favourite fanservice ship they love to push
extra hard and it‚Äôs clear that‚Äôs geonmaet for wk1 + it‚Äôs easy for them to push
them bc geonmaet themselves love playing it up and whoring out for the cameras
