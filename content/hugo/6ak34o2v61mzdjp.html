      <p>Has he been getting fillers ?? it looks mainly like his cheekbones have changed
imo but he's talked about losing weight so it can't be from weight gain.</p>

      <p>fhhfhrhr that's crazy personally i think this is the best he's ever looked
(kfans agree too) but i can agree with the lips especially when the makeup is
too much

      <p>just got this on my for you page and this would've been just after the finale as
i remember this was from that vcr in kcon japan (wow what a time)... not just zh
and hb but they all looked p good bc they were more untouched from
fillers/surgery/crazy weight loss and also they look like babies too lmao
