      <p>Now camping on Weibo and watching the cr0s1ns try attempt number 3175465 to
overthrow/take back control of their cbar cos they've had enough of the cbar
heads....let's see if they succeed this time, I theorise the cbar heads has yh
staff in there but the r0s1ns have numbers on their end.</p>

      <p>Eeehh, yh is known for contacting cbars and coordinating events with them so
that the cbar can later relay accurate information to the fans but I don't think
they actually manage any cbar. The heads of Rk's old cbar were scammers and a
new cbar had to be created by other fans just last year, Yj's current cbar
almost quit out of stress, and R*s1n Estrella (Zh's third cbar) was created way
before he won bp. The identity of the 3 admins of Zh's current cbar is public
knowledge and they're just very stubborn fans with huge egos. If anyone wants
tea, their weibo user names are @持证发财 @奔奔喜欢吃榴莲 and @怪力少女梁春娇 But yeah, they need
to step down.</p>

      <p>Holy shit crosins actually did it. The three admins left 🎉🎉🎉 the new problem
is that the cbar has no management now but they opened applications again so
maybe they'll announce the new admins soon.</p>
