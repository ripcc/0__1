      <p>Sorry I don’t trust these people to translate objectively, is it correct because
all my translator say “but lost the top spot to zhg” which is a completely
different sentence. I mean not that the og is that deep either but ?

      <p>the way they said exactly that in both korean and english versions of the
article and then changed the wording because they were called out 😭😭 these
korean reporters have a history of disrespecting foreign idols idk why is that
surprising.. also that's literally what the verb 내주다 in korean means = to hand
over or offer something, basically saying janbin handed over or gave up the the
top place to jao like he wasn't dying for it like every other trainee hghghtgh</p>
