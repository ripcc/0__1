      <p>heyyyyy this is kinda random but i remember a while back u mentioned being a
receptionist (i think?) and i've been on a job search and have been debating
applying for receptionist roles since i've been having lots of trouble getting a
job and it sounds pretty alright BUT one of the big things that's putting me off
applying is the whole answering phone calls thing since i get scared about those
like i'm the type of person that has to psych myself up and have a whole script
before i make a phone call and i assume a receptionist job would involve
multiple a day (also i feel like i have a lisp like no one has ever commented on
it but i can hear my own voice and sometimes ppl don't know what i'm saying so
idk if hearing that on a phone call when voices are already pretty hard to
hear/understand would be helpful lmao) ðŸ˜­ i was wondering if u were the type to
hate phone calls too and if u find this aspect of the job fine, if u got
training for all u have to say etc etc or if ur chill with them anyway and how u
get over that</p>
