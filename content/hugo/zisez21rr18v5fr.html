      <p>H@knyeon saying heâ€™s innocent and getting into a legal battle with his company
and news outlets for allegedly misreporting prost!tution is insane. If he is
telling the truth (on the slight chance) then I feel horrible for him. If heâ€™s
lying, he needs to rot. Regardless, this will drag things out for awhile and
will be messy af, especially since the members unfollowed him on their personal
insta accounts. You could argue the companies control those but idk man. Imagine
your company lying about you that you did something illegal and kicking you out
to get a huge penalty fee from you and your bandmates who you grew up with and
liked (at least a few of them) didnâ€™t believe you and you were simultaneously
removed. And this all happens after your entire group signed to a new label
together since you wanted to stay as one and continue being a group. And you
only had one comeback from the new label. Messyyyyy.</p>
