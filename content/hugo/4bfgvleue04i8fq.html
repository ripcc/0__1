      <p>Ok but a tiny part of me understands it like she got the hybe /runext clout and
is easily the most popular in the group. When I watched iland i actually thought
they really wanted to push koko but ig since they need this group to work out
theyâ€™ve decided to push her</p>

      <p>my two cents that no one asked for but this is a case where i think kpop
companies are the ones who fuel akgaeism and fandom divison the most, like you
want to push someone fine just don't make it so blatant? or balance out the
schedules in a way that suits the members idk ignoring the japanese members and
giving it to her for kcon JAPAN is just crazy like i know their fandom is
already shading this jeemin girl, same thing happened with zb1 in 2023 and i'll
always blame wk1 for that but anywayyyy we can't be the only ones terrorized by
akgaes ðŸ¤£</p>
