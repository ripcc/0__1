      <p><p>... uhm.. I feel that we&apos;re starting to spiral.. you could be onto smth but their cb would probably be around the time b2p starts airing? So what then</p><img src="<a href="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pjt-knowledge.appspot.com/o/content-attachments%2F23b5ba4e-6e53-48a4-918a-ae50c7669d08.jpg?alt=media">https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pjt-knowledge.appspot.com/o/content-attachments%2F23b5ba4e-6e53-48a4-918a-ae50c7669d08.jpg?alt=media</a>"><p></p></p>

      <p>Ok I donâ€™t think exactly like anon but I do wonder if they are prolonging the
gap between their next cb as much as possible because itâ€™s a full album and will
be their last. Like in their head if they release it too early they will spend
the rest of the year with nothing new. I fear in wk1s mind they may actually do
aug/sept so we have full on promotions that go straight into the tour and then
award season.</p>

      <p><p>yuppp if they released in june theyd have a gap pre tour theyre probably gonna stretch the promotions by 0.1 only for full album vibes ðŸ˜’ and then poof bleakness idt theyre deeping the svs group too hard theyd basically cut their promos period if that was the case</p></p>

      <p>idk maybe they'll do one of those disbandment singles ðŸ˜­ that'll really kill me
but idk i feel like a final goodbye like that is deserved and makes sense with
their fame level (even tho i don't think w1 or iz0ne had one but like that was
like 7 years ago and their circumstances would've been a bit different + but
then at the same time wake1 are so trash idk if they'd even plan for that and be
able to get it together. disbandment singles are always shit and feel like
nothing so could be for the best)</p>
