      <p>oh i remember someone mentioning this ages ago in another cc or something.. i
think itâ€™s just a theory bc thereâ€™s a popular k-nb account (forgot the @) that
also has gureum as their dn but IDK i feel like that makes it too obvious that
it would be them and wouldnâ€™t allins be mad as hell about it ðŸ˜­ maybe theyâ€™ve
openly acknowledged it before tho idk. i wanna know who these k accounts with
shipper alts are tho ðŸ‘€</p>
