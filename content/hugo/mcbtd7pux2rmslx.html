      <p><p>I don&apos;t know a whole lot about them but TAKE THIS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT!!! A kfan who was talking ab gyuvins ex relationship early 2024 also said that yshi dated kyungmn from twc. The gyuvin rumor is credible so this has a little substance but it&apos;s also just left field to me and idk either nwish/twc lol</p></p>
