      <p>His ment made no sense tho because he talked about solo stages and so it's like
you fought to...not have a solo stage? When he designed everything about always
alone? It was very obviously damage control given the crowd reactions</p>

      <p>he called it the solo corner cuz it was 7 solo stages of course he’s not gonna
specify it as solo and duo corner?? this is misinterpretation of his words the
whole point of the ment was that they wanted to do something different for this
fancon aka songs they chose. for all we know they could have solos tomorrow but
it’s really frustrating as a zgh fan to see other fans never satisfied with what
he does like did the cbar drama mean nothing to you people</p>
