      <p>pronouns always go a bit weird when looking up machine translations, are they
saying the members themselves wanted to renew or that the fans want that for
them????? and if they've already worked out where they're gonna go, does that
mean that if any leave their original company, they already know/have worked
that out (other than actually choosing a different company to go to since i know
there's apparently laws and stuff surrounding that)???????? but wow this really
made it sink in like i was one of the zroses that's always been 95% sure they
won't renew or 'turn permanent' but this actually made me wanna off myself LMAO</p>

      <p><p>basically they said their acquaintance told them a while ago that the members already have their future plans made and that op wanted them to extend but now they&apos;re just gonna enjoy them. so this could mean that most of them have those short shadow contracts and if they leave they have their futures sorted out in other companies OR they&apos;re all under longer contracts with the og companies and there&apos;s plans in motions the former lowkey seems more believable I don&apos;t believe all of them would stay in their companies.
