      <p>Looks like wekwan is really trying to push zebone into irrelevance, but
honestly, all itâ€™s doing is fueling more spite in me

      <p>They really are trying ever since that show got announced ðŸ˜‘ I almost fell for
it and Im one of their strongest soldiers. There is nothing proper to look out
for if you are an Ot9 fan... I dont want to know how many people switched up
during the past few weeks. I keep on seeing made this account just for the show
so Zer0ses dont shit on me posts. I fear that some of our big fan accs might
have switched to the dark side</p>

      <p>I'm so used to getting none from gw and only his lives, this hiatus is just him
for his whole career. At least now he can entertain us more thru live because
looks like jelfish is the only one who got no plan for post dword. Plus I see
most gpds are rmees, rather than sit for bp they just going back to beeteeS</p>
