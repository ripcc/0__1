      <p>I assumed they split the revenue evenly between the members (after it goes
through the music handler/wk1/their respective companies) but it actually makes
sense that they get more depending on how much the individual buyers bought. We
can't even joke about him using the money to buy his gf a van cleef necklace bc
it jao so idk hope he buys something nice for janbin</p>

      <p><p>ig it depends on how the music handler allocates the funds? because the way ppl are bidding on that app isn&apos;t actually how it hits the company. it&apos;s still coming to them in the form of albums idt there&apos;s any way to actually track how much money is going for each member but obv checking socmed u can find out they&apos;re probably splitting the entire revenue of the event </p></p>
