      <p>Top 3 visuals to watch in the next couple years from newly debuted boy groups:
1. Yeoyeoje0ng (from Newbe@t - check out his face in their ‘Jello’ m/v; he’s the
white haired one but he looks really good with the right styling even with those
veneerz), 2. Z!heng from Pol@rix (this one might be controversial but like his
face eatssss in certain lightings and when he’s barefaced - with the right
styling he’s a stunnerrrr), 3. Kyoungb@e from Cl0se Y0ur Eyes (he’s the maknae
but he has really unique features and an endearing smile - I think he’s one of
those lucky kids who’ll grow into their features, he reminds me of Yuj!n a bit).
Ma J!ng X!ang is super handsome too and he’s from the same group but that’s old
Boys Planet tea. Runner ups for face card interest: B!ng F@n from N0uera and
Ham!n, H@nbi, and Nich0l@as from S.M-Tra!nees (when they debut - the rest of the
trainee batch have very noticeable filler or plastic surgery that is hard to
ignored).</p>
