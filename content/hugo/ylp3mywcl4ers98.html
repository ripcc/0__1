      <p>As a r-s-n, i think my own moots crashed out so unnecessarily. Yes, I can
understand being disappointed or upset they weren't acknowledged, feeling that
the members could have done more, and feeling emotional over the whole situation
but I don't agree with the way they started lashing out and mocking the members,
being so harsh as if they were the root of the problem. All it did was provoke a
fanwar and rile people up. No point or goal was accomplished. Being emotional
doesn't mean you have to resort to mocking and if you really felt the need to be
shady, you should know when to stop. I'm sure they wouldn't be so aggressive if
they actually had clarity on the issue which is 99% visa. It was confusing so
they needed someone to take it out on. I'm not even trying to be a saint because
I lash out too but genuinely what did all of that accomplish? They could have
expressed disappointment without doubling down so hard to the point the whole
fandom was subtweeting them and going down rabbitholes of unrelated arguments.
The interview was given, the picture was taking, and they're leaving. I hope the
company get sued for mismanagement of h/r/b/z, their blatant lies to cover up
their mistake, and not doing enough pr to comfort and compensate the fans but
besides that what can we do about how the members who were present already
handled the situation? Nobody's even talking about the visa issue and people are
now switching up to blaming h/r/b/z for "hiding". Stop being so harsh on them
god. Arguing about f4milyb4se0ne or not is practically discussing with no goal
in mind other than expressing anger and I wish they didn't take it so far jesus.</p>
