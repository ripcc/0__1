      <p>LMAOOOO no wonder sleepone is trying to bury jbs and get 12 to promote bopel2.
They got 2 of their trainees as the shiny boys or whatever and one even being
the "center" of pre promotion. I know they already counting the nonexistent
money they might get. It is obvious the favoritism is gonna be wiiild after
debut and sucks because the contract is 5y. Good luck in advance to debut
members, even if the group is successful it would be a long hellish ride</p>

      <p>this isn’t even anything new tbh bc i just remembered with bp they had k-wkonez
(tr, ljh, mjh, phb, m1nseok) g-wkonez (h4ruto, 4nthonny, m1n - tho i’m p sure
they signed them solely for the show, especially 4nthonny since he was signed
like a month or less before auditions were closed or something, since they were
kicked a month or so after zbwon were formed) and also j1hoo (and the other one
i forgot the name of, he stopped being a trainee i’m p sure) who they sneakily
transferred to that label j4y p4rk had under cj just to move him back for a bit
after bp and then have him debut in 3vnne like that’s 10 whole trainees i know
they were mad as hell when it was just tr that got in and phb didn’t even scrape
by into the top 9</p>
