      <p>Me going back in time so bp removes that solo song prize from p01 my god they
never said he'll be entitled to get treated like a solo artist at every single
event they do. In the future enjoy him as a flop solo artist or the same
miserable existence in the next group tho ‚úåüèº</p>

      <p>It didn't link but I was actually replying to the person who said hao is the
ONLY one who should have a solo stage all 3 days and that "always" should always
be part of their setlist.. no one actually gives a fuck about what y'all want or
don't want being valid or not we were just checking your entitlement</p>
