      <p>Almost two weeks and last time it took him two weeks to come too lmfao



Im a riyangi btw and I have a feeling n0yb knows rik just doesnt want to go on
pc and isnt on any pc ban because they havent tweaked at all for the past month
when they would crash out when he wouldn't post after 3 days with the whole 'see
told ya, w1 let him come on pc for 1 day to shut us up and now he's on a pc ban
again' typa bullshit.



I feel like a ris prob asked him at a fan sign/call and he cleared it up but
noyb/ ris dont want riyangis to know because that means rik isn't mistreated and
wont work with the mistreatment agenda they tryna push. Surprised dumbass
riyangis havent found it odd why n0yb who used to be first to crash out and qrt
all pc ban related tweets suddenly havent... but their dumb and dense so im not
surprised.



Also its funny because noyb still tweaks about tiktok/ ig posts so i bet their
logic is 'juSt bEcAUse he dOeSNt want tO coMe on pc DOesNt mEan hE doESnt waNt
to pOst oN tIKtok/ ig! He is STill sNS bANnED'</p>
