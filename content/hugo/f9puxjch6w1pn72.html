      <p>all of them lurk on xhs and weibo to get tea to drag the other one so it's safe
to say they have selective vision for a lot of things</p>

      <p>nah as someone who does entertain the idea of jaobin being real Idk where this
idea that chinese jao fans think jaobin is real came from? believe it or not a
lot of chinese jao fans don't even think he's gay and even believed him when he
was joking around saying that he's motae solo 😭 they're all gf stans. even the
chinese jao fans who do think he's gay including the hardcore ones who dig a lot
into his past don't think jaobin is real. i'm not saying they're right there's
definitely selective vision going on and i don't think it changes what we think
of jaobin that's just the overall perception over there it's very similar to
kfan mentality except with additional akgaeism added that would make people even
less likely to call it real</p>
