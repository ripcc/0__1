      <p>iirc jao once mentioned in an interview that he decided to sign with them bc
they promised that they'd debut him but they ended up putting him a bplanet so i
guess it makes sense that his contract is shorter than the rest?</p>

      <p><p>a promise is diff than on paper but idk I doubt that they&apos;d make him sign anything less than 5-6 yrs even if that was the case</p></p>

      <p>i'm lowkey not sure why everyone's doubting this because it really is common
knowledge if you kick it with crosins especially the hardcore ones lmao his
contract isn't even an artist contract it's like 3 years i think</p>

      <p>idk if its the same in jao's case but project groups' members usually only
signed the trainee contract with their OG companies thats why they could debut
under a different company for a certain period of time because signing the
artist contract(5-7years) under two diff companies dont seem possible (thats why
wj/sn and un/iq didnt work, the members ended up staying only in one company)</p>

      <p>this wasnâ€™t the case with wanna 1 tho because before they officially debuted
there were articles about the members signing artist contracts with their
original companies and if you look at those members (with the exception of
kdaniel and kuanlin since they had lawsuits) theyâ€™re either still there or left
once the 7 year mark hit (jiho0n and bae jy)</p>
