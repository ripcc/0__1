sworn a saw a video of him gagging at durian once üò≠üò≠üò≠</p>

      <p>"Appear quirky" this anon is certainly not a fan because theres a reason why ppl
get annoyed at his durian personalityüò≠ its def not a concept. he literally is
so good at cutting it up, thats only real durian lovers who can do it. the
gagging you mentioned was prob the durian fusion food? something mixed with
kimchi which of course very understandable to have such a reaction LOL or did
you mean the durian perfume?</p>
