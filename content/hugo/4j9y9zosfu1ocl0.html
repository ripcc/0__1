      <p>nah he got shat on bad they kept saying his head is big, bad body proportions,
looks evil, green card traitor, looks like he's raised by triads because of his
piercings and tattoos, leech (this is from crosins), looks like he belongs in a
peking opera because of his thick makeup etc... these comments weren't even from
rosin akgaes or c kpop akgaes it was from the general public who watched running
man and their first impression of him. his response on douyin was good on the
other hand but that's because they're more young and know about kpop but
everywhere else was pretty bad. cent is just evil and will work him dry, gonna
make him weigh 80lbs because all male actors are sickly stick thin and will
control him wayyy more than wk1 for whatever image they want to push on him and
don't get me started on the political stance bullshit that will make him lose
all his kfans and even ifans.</p>

      <p>Lol people have to understand that the kpop fan circle and a normal user are
very different, I have a lot of friends who know Ricky through Keep Running and
to them Ricky is just a handsome guy who appeared once in a show they watch
daily. If they find him interesting, at most they'll follow his super topic, do
you think normal people see a guy they don't like and their first reaction is to
scold him online? Do you think a normal person will pay attention to a blogger's
weibo head size comparison post or a mocking post of his makeup on douban wc?
It's normal for celebrities to get scolded, those bloggers and platforms were
born to scold people, but unless it gets out of the fan circle, that reaction is
only from a small group of boring people. Who give a fuck like that? I don't
like Ricky's makeup and I don't hope he will be active in China either, we have
enough bad actors who only live off data but saying he has bad reaction in China
is not right</p>

      <p>I think both are true to an extent Im not either previous anon but I saw both
that rk got a lot of hate comments in fanspaces more than you would normally get
and that a bunch of casual nonfans thought he was cute and don't care about
fandom opinions imo he's a very polarizing visual in china they either love it
or hate it there's less of an in between whereas yj for example is a more
palatable visual</p>
