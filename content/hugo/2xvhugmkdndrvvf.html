      <p>okay i know rky is part of the problem and doesn't wanna hustle but lowkey its
getting weird how he's hardly in official content, like if i was a casual fan i
wouldn't even know he's part of the group based on their social media. also when
he's rarely ever interviewed individually in the zepisodes. i'm not even a rky
stan but ive been noticing how even the members mention him less and less and
it's just weird, i wonder if smth is going on behind the scenes. he's never
mentioned in the stories with the other members. damn i miss my ot9 family ðŸ¥²</p>
