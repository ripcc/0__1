      <p>I could think of a few scenerios:



1)They're either probably going to show how he dorms with the manager

2) or the "room" he stays at when they have promotions

3) or randomly creates a room for him to stay

4) or flat out say he doesn't live there (which might be unlikely since the
whole show is suppose to reveal how jebis live in dorms and their dynamics ðŸ¤”)</p>
