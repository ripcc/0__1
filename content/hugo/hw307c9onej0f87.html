      <p>he does this with any member tbh but one thing that irks so much about jw and
zhg is that all their moments consist of being up each other's faces, random
hugs, kissy faces it's so awkward in that like there's never a solid
conversation or heartwarming interaction so idk why zeroses gag at their moments</p>
