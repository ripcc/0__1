This was the moment I knew it was time to unstan. Likeâ€¦ what kind of marketing
is that? ðŸ˜­ you finally have a survival show group closest to the hype the
produce groups ha, they just debuted, and instead of focusing on promoting the
full group and pushing the song everywhere to go for that potential high chart
(especially when Korean GP had an hyper focus on the idol market because of IVE
and New Jeans comeback), youâ€™re making shipping the main promotional strategy?
That should be something the fanbase naturally does, not the company. I still
find it laughable they turned the debut into a fanfiction starter pack.</p>

      <p>sorry all of the things u said is very true req but wdym debut was when u had to
unstan? we had everything on a silver platter jdnkdksks tingle interview is a
staple for ALL groups and we had like 10 diff ot9 vids that came out before and
after this tingle interview so what the fuckkkkk r u talking about wk1 did a lot
of wrong things but they didn't make shipping the main promotional strategy it
was zrses themselves or rather it's just a general kpop fans problem idk what to
tell u</p>
