      <p>tbh when you see how often most idols especially in 5th gen come online to
communicate with their fans you realize how good zbwon actually are in that
aspect there was once a trending post on instiz and kfans were praising them for
that (members who come often at least) like idt most zeros realize coming online
everyday isn't the norm for kpop idols but the problem is the group content we
get compared to other groups ðŸ˜­ i remember w1sh y1shi getting dragged for
ghosting his fans for almost a month and then coming back to reply with a ã…‹ã…‹ to
a fan who told him to be more active jssksks</p>
