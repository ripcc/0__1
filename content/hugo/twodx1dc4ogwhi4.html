      <p>Isn't noyb chinese? I saw an anon the other day say she mistranslated the
gyubr!k spotting and now she did this. Unless it's intentional and she purposely
makes things sound worst to rile up riyang!s

      <p>she always talks abt making her dad get stuff for her when theres pop ups in
shanghai so she must have moved here for school or smthn and then stayed did u
see the ris airing their grievances abt her using translate in ryangi opps ns😭
she wants to control the narrative so bad but u can tell most of his dedicated
fans have silently figured it out by now these days the tweets i see abt rky
being banned mostly come from gyubrkers lol</p>

      <p>i just catched up on her neo rn after anon reminded me bout them but damn
riyangis aint fking with the roleplay fancalls at alll 😭 lowks i get ittt
because he does nothing and there's no solo content so the only solo content
they get are fancall content but imo his fancalls are pretty chill tbh barely mt
level beggary LMFAOOOO just same scirpt every time with everyone but ya if thats
all they get it and see it does leave a bad taste</p>

      <p>i'm reading their neo right now too asdfaslkfhal she types so god damn much but
why she right though. I'm reading her essay about fancalls and how it enables
parasocial relationship and how it keeps escalating cuz it really do be just
like that</p>

      <p>to her defense as someone who types a lot i can tell gurlie been through a lot
😭 this is a result of being misunderstood and ppl twisting their words so they
have to make sure their point is clear 😭 i mean shes stuck with schizo riyangis
so it makes sense 😭</p>
