      <p>noyb is delusional and a pathological liar lmaoooo the only hot search that's
been bought was for the kick it stage but if she's talking about zgh she's crazy
because with or without hot searches he's ten times more relevant there, also rk
has been falling off like crazy on cside and has been losing fans mainly because
of his inactivity some riice and wish members have more sign-ins than him
nowadays</p>

      <p>Him bulking up isn't helping either sadly... if you guys think kfans hate it,
cfans hate it even more. They're twink city over there in general and his
aesthetics just changed a lot from the beginning and a lot of his stans are
aesthetic stans w.e i think he's hot now just needs to lay off that nose contour
and we good.</p>
