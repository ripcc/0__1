      <p>Has he been getting fillers ?? it looks mainly like his cheekbones have changed
imo but he's talked about losing weight so it can't be from weight gain.</p>

too much

      <p><p>I rlly think lips is the biggest thing for me like somebody has to dissolve that in his sleep it&apos;s not tea but it&apos;s def preference he was so attractive to me in 2023</p></p>

      <p>and he naturally has pretty pouty lips so honestly the lip fillers are not
needed sigh i think he still looks good but i'm not a fan of the obvious filler
look so i hope he dissolves them soon



as a side note, i think one of reasons he looks pretty different now compared to
like 2023 is also due to overall makeup/styling... he used to wear his hair down
over his forehead a lot more often which gave him a softer look, now it's
usually styled up and away. there's also something about his eye-makeup that
looks different but i can't quite pinpoint it. i think they used to make his
eyes look more elongated/winged but now it looks like maybe the focus is on
making them look bigger and on enhancing his aegyosal... ?idk i'm no expert on
this, but in any case i feel like when his hair is down and his makeup is more
subtle he looks a bit more like his 2023 self (lips notwithstanding)</p>
