      <p>i wonder what post-disbandment is gonna be like with member perceptions bc i
know with w1 i think w4nnables hate j43hwan, especially with that drama with him
claiming j1nyoung was being bullied by c1x but idk if they felt/expressed this
during the group's run, there's probably similar with exwon, i don't think the
produce ggs have really experienced that so i think it's a bg fanbase thing ðŸ˜­
like who are zroses gonna still rock with, who will they drop (this is more like
w1zones since none of them gaf about the j members minus s4kura and then i don't
think they really care about the non-le ss3rafim/1ve members now that i think
about it other than like y3na? i'd say tr is gonna fall into this but i wonder
if other members will) and are they gonna admit to secretly hating members bc i
had a vision of this happening with jw the day right after disbandment, like
everyone just airing their grievances out LMAO</p>
