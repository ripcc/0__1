      <p>i was gonna ask about what's happening.. from what i've seen there's jy
dating/smoking, him sy and hj having pretty young girls over at their dorm (i
think? it was like 04 and 06 what i saw) and then someone in a discord i'm in
sent some we1b0 link about jy offering a girl to take a molka of yh that he'd
send to her which didn't reach the intl side apparently????? i keep seeing ppl
say disbandment but idk if they're saying that bc of all the scandals or if
that's ANOTHER rumour that's being spread during all this (but lowkey teebeezee
go through it all the time so are we sure that this is fr gonna take them down).
is there anything else i'm missing?</p>

i don't get why sw would spread the group is splitting up if they just signed
with a whole other company and had a cb tho ðŸ˜­ unless he said that to ppl before
all that stuff happened</p>
