      <p>Gw and Tr beefing fr is so funny. Probably one of the only times I’ve been
reminded that Gw is a 20 year old dude and that maybe he isn’t as mature as I
thought, still love him tho. Tr should be more flexible (speaking as someone who
is the same way as he is but realized my rigidity is not super welcoming)
meanwhile Gw shouldn’t be so headstrong either (also maybe don’t dog pile
someone too). Both need to grow a little, but I’m thankful to see when they act
a little immature. It feels genuine. I’m sure the solo stans are having a field
day but it’s just a small disagreement and they’ll resolve and grow closer from
it. People taking it seriously and like they killed each other’s mothers is
taking me outttt</p>
