      <p>its bcs his shoulders are very narrow tho? there is no other reason to wear
shoulder pads. it also "fixes" his proportions (i prefer his proportions wo the
pads). its a stylistic choice for sure or so gf stans can thirst over something.
if you notice he never really shows his whole back, just sides from it (when
shirtless)</p>
