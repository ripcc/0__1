      <p><p>that&apos;s still early enough to feel the vibes but icl the finale was smth speciallll they bonded all their fans via tweak afterwards tho so we all have the illness. but my only goal and focus back then was to get gunwook in the group I wanted jnhyeon in the group cuz that&apos;s his bestie and i liked him but I understood it would&apos;ve never worked and he would&apos;ve got the group dragged. tbh even tho i hated half the group to death i knew this was the optimal lineup for clout so I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way even w jwg ðŸ˜’</p></p>
