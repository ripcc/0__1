      <p>the contract extenstion is not happening so of course wkone will prefer to just
invest in this new group that will last for five years hence they&#x27;re trying to
make zbone&#x27;s fans jump to this ship. this is not even a conspiracy theory girl
if you&#x27;re a fan you&#x27;ll notice this</p>

      <p>As a matter of fact I&#x27;m gonna go on a conspiracy theory myself and say that now
that extensions have failed cj/wk1 is trying to tell the original companies who
didn&#x27;t fall in line &quot;see what happens when you and your boys don&#x27;t accept our
proposal for extension- they get tossed&quot;</p>
