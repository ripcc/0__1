      <p>i think matty&#x27;s probably the only one who could possibly find this if he really
tried also it&#x27;ll be funny af if he saw one of ur cancel threads LMFAOOOOO and
kept tabs for the juicy gossip ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ tbh i think the members are all nosey
about themselves and what their fans are gossiping about like im pretty sure
most of them know about their own dcgalls</p>
