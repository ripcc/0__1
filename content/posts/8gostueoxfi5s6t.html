      <p>i follow them from bp days just bc i wanted to see them posting about seeing the
trainees and i found it funny how they'd annoy everyone (i can't really remember
why tbh), especially happys**binday (like when she said she met a nugu idol at a
club or something then went to his dorm with him after which is when
happys**binday tweeted "i'm at his house" and no one believed it - i did tbh
it's not the craziest thing to imagine. what's funny, relating to that, is when
t*eraeday came back to post about bp2 she posted then quickly deleted a pic from
that day of them allegedly sitting with this guy in his dorm (?), no faces
shown, so i guess they might continue to stir shit) so i was surprised to see
them pop up on my tl almost instantly about bp2 bc they've been inactive as hell
since bp



wasn't happys**binday a gw one pick LMAO unless she had other trainees as picks
too.... there was probably some d*eul stanning in there



t*eraeday intrigues me bc as soon as she left korea she dgaf about kpop and it's
like she was never a 3vnne/tr/kpop stan in the first place like i know the y/n,
in person fan service aspect is one of the biggest things in kpop but
damnnnnnnnn</p>
