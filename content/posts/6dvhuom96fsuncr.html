      <p>i don’t see it. i’m not watching the show but from the little i’ve seen from
both trainees, g3onwoo has that good boy, flower visual image while s4ngwon
seems a lil edgier? maybe his predebut ‘scandals’ are affecting my perception of
him a bit but idk. talent wise i know nothing about them but i feel like they
probably can’t compare to hb in terms of skills, even if dance is their
specialty and they have fine vocals</p>
