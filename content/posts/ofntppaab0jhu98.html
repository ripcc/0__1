      <p>i keep seeing people saying they&#x27;ve become zroses in the past few WEEKS and
MONTHS like i love them but what could possibly draw you in atp like it doesn&#x27;t
feel like much is happening content wise and it&#x27;s not that fun of a fan
experience (i remember i used to be an 0rbit and i unstanned because i couldn&#x27;t
take dealing with beebeecee anymore lmfao i think i&#x27;ve stayed with zbwon because
my love for them is more than it was for 1oona but also because i feel like i
need to see it through til the end since they&#x27;ll be gone forever soon. if zbwon
were permanent, it might be different because i&#x27;ve lowkey been equally if not
more annoyed with wake1 than i was with beebeecee LMAO), it just feels like
we&#x27;re constantly going through hell outside of the members being very talented.
i can&#x27;t even imagine not being a fan from the beginning like i remember during
1zone&#x27;s run, i debated looking into them more and maybe even becoming a fan but
the longer they went on, the less appealing it seemed since there was less time
left</p>

      <p><p>it&apos;s inevitable I guess since it&apos;s normal in kpop for ppl to become fans at any point but why zbwon they&apos;re ending like tmrw cjjdjcjkdkdmxk I GUESS THEYRE THAT LIT AYEEEEE. But hold on nah I rlly dislike wkn but BUMBA BEBECE??? Idk the shit I&apos;ve seen them do is insane to me idt we got it that bad wkn remind me of ist more ðŸ˜­ they squashed tvz popularity in every way possible icb im subjected to this again. but maybe its easier to bear being a new fan when there&apos;s shit to catch up on + experiencing the wkn that makes less mistakes NVNFNMFN LIKE WE HAD IT WORSE</p></p>
