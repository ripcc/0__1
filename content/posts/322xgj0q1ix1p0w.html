      <p>im gonna be so real his apology about it was actually good and quick, it seems

      <p>Okay but why would a korean man who just got discharged from korean military
announce he&#x27;s pro a right wing party in japan ðŸ’€ not trying to defend him bc
idgaf but it genuinely just sounds like a dumb mistake and he also said he threw
the hat away so</p>

      <p>i dont want to defend him and i think it&#x27;s ignorant as hell but lowkey i dont
think many of u realise how many normal people outside the us don&#x27;t recognise
that phrase and the associations it would have lol they&#x27;d deadass only think
it&#x27;s a cool hat about tokyo. i cant speak for korea specifically though

obviously anyone educated knows but i dont expect that from 95% of idols</p>
