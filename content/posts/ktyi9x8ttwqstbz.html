      <p>I actually like this question because it makes me think like on the rare chance
that 1/2 leave and the rest stay ( I can even see a situation where yh pull out
zh but leave the other 3) what do you think would genuinely happen. Like in that
scenario of loosing hbn heâ€™s the leader and one of the most popular members so
itâ€™s not like weâ€™d be loosing a filler (no shade)</p>

      <p><p>now that u mention it I could see yh just deciding to speed up zghs chn career if the other 3 are secure in zbwon but that&apos;s where the problem starts. we rlly aren&apos;t ever getting a kepla story because losing a center or a leaders diff than losing some booboo mshiro </p></p>

      <p>Ignoring my hatred for a11ins I can see jebiz-2 doing well if hb stays and if jw
leaves. That way gp will give us a chance and we&#x27;ll still have our leader and
I&#x27;ll admit he does a good job. I really think yh will do anything to get zh back
tho since his path is pretty similar to wangyib0 both talented all rounder and
insane fandom buying power.</p>
