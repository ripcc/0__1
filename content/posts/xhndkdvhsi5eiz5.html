      <p>saw this in another mond but do you think jao has some kinda connection now with
an embc producer or smth because they’re kinda giving him a few gigs with that
dorm panelist then his drama cameo and now he’s narrating their travel show
considering it’s a korean broadcasting station so they’re a bit conservative and
all</p>

      <p>realistic speaking tho how can a foreigner have a connection in kr, its not like
he came from a super rich family either or had some experiences in kr before.
its probably just them took a liking in him &amp; pretty sure his popularity plays a
big role too and if you notice, all his embc gigs are just so fitting to him.
the taiwanese role and this travel show is also about china idt anyone else
among his peers(5th gen) can pull these</p>
