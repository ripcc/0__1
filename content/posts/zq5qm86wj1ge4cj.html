      <p>yeah i can see him replacing hbn as mnets son if he debuts guy‚Äôs cute, soft
spoken and probably speak better english and japanese than hbn (deduced from a
few secs clip üëÄ), plays piano, not as good as hbn in dancing but he can dance,
got a good voice too and he‚Äôs so much TALLER than hbn feels bad for hbn as an
alln but errr it‚Äôs life ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
