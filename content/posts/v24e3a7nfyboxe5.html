      <p>See hereâ€™s the thing I can understand the focus on haobin and the managers since
the shows concept does focus on the managers and panelist but idt any of us
would be as annoyed if they actually showed the managers working and actually
doing useful shit for the members and like we donâ€™t need to go see f3 and jao go
eat malatang like why didnâ€™t they film this shit during promo like ofc this shit
was going to be dead when all they had going on was a fs and nothing else</p>
