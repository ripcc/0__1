      <p>wk1 is dumb for trying to make j33min happen they don’t know pushing individual
members rarely works and that pushing the entire group is key. It kinda happened
to zb1 too unfortunately that tactic only works if it’s like a carina wony
situation but j33min doesn’t have that</p>

      <p>theyre trying to give others solo gigs while giving jmn the mnet resources i
think they believe by giving everyone their own gigs from the start and not just
one member like zbwon its gonna prevent the chaos but what they dont understand
is its only gna work if the whole group is pushed at once and not thru 1 or 2
members</p>

      <p><p>this is a way better method than what we got but svs groups NEED group content because nobody is trynna stan a solo collective. fans need a chance to like and see this group as one before that but wkn never learns lol like what happened to the debut reality show recipe... but gg to izma cuz were out ✌️</p></p>
