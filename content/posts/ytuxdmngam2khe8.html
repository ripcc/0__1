      <p>I saw someone else say this but Iâ€™d like to know people opinions on this. They
said that the reason 0s and even solos and akgaes with ship him with anyone is
not because of a perceived image but because deep down most these people are gf
stans and will make a situation sexual/ romantic to self insert</p>

      <p><p>ðŸ¤” hmmmmm i see where ur going but i think its def the image thing that precedes that. gf stanning and shipping has always been intertwined but you only see this w idols who r dubbed the thotty members. like all those nasty mtt harem fans act liek that cuz they rlly think thats his vibe </p></p>

      <p>u just saying anything anon cuz most of his solos and akgaes don&#x27;t even like him
to be shipped with anyone lol.. zrs are another conversation and honestly they
do the same with multiple members? idk i feel like some people are trying to
blow this interaction out of porportions because they&#x27;re just jealous shippers
and they felt threatened or smth ðŸ˜­</p>
