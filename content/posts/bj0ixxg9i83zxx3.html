      <p>other than that unit (eg hyung line) fancall they're doing for japan zroses and
the fansign in shanghai, do they have any more fansigns/fancalls coming up? bc
zepository doesn't have any others listed but it also might not just be up to
date... i hope they're done with those fansigns PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE WE NEED REAL
CONTENT!!!!!!!!!! tho we're never getting it so i can't hope for the fansigns to
be replaced with good ot9 shit i guess 😔 we signed the most fucked up deal in
the world</p>
