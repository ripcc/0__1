      <p>i find it funny how kats3ye fans say that they&#x27;re a global group but they&#x27;re
promoting like a kpop group, going to multiple korean music shows and release
music in the same way a kpop group does, all their fans are going to be just
kpop fans but kpop fans will always prioritize their kpop groups so at then end
they&#x27;ll never be successful globally and they also won&#x27;t be a popular gg in
korea, idk what hybe is thinking on marketing them like that</p>
