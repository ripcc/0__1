      <p>saw this in another mond but do you think jao has some kinda connection now with
an embc producer or smth because theyâ€™re kinda giving him a few gigs with that
dorm panelist then his drama cameo and now heâ€™s narrating their travel show
considering itâ€™s a korean broadcasting station so theyâ€™re a bit conservative and
all</p>

      <p>This is one of those rare cases where being a foreigner helped him get gigs. The
drama character is taiwanese so hiring a chinese/taiwanese person makes sense,
and the cast of the travel show went on a trip to china so it also makes sense
to have a chinese person do the narration. But I also think he might've gotten
close to an embc pd lol we'll see. If they also give him a drama ost then I'll
be convinced someone at embc likes him.</p>

      <p>>need a cn or tw actor to play a tw character

>hire zho

>need a cn narrator for a travel show in china

>hire zho

And nothing for rky fr ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ damn nobody wants him or what. Reminds me of
that special knowing bros(? episode with foreigners where mtt and zho went but
rky didn't, then there was that jtb< show with foreigners again where everyone
and their mamas went but rky was forgotten once again... like iirc mtt was in
one of the eps as a special guest because zho invited him but what about rky?
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Why didn't zho invite him too? Where's the cn to cn solidarity?</p>

      <p>idk if you get this but rik feels more american than chinese to me. he doesnt
scream ì¤‘í‹° the way jao does if it makes sense? he acts like asian american kid so
i guess thats why ppl dont think of him when it comes chinese kpop idol? i mean
even his stage name is in english</p>
