      <p>IT IS PRETTY AVERAGE but idk something about it made me go "oh ðŸ˜•" because with
the hb thing it reminded me of how yuq1 said in cub3 they made her like the
standard for weight, would shame trainees for gaining weight by printing out
hers and putting it on the office buildings walls and then with zh he was
talking about a specific number of kgs so i was just reminded of the severity of
it and these bits of info coming out within such a short time of each other so i
was just like "DAMN"</p>
