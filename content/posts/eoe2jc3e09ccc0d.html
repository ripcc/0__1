      <p>(Genuinely sorry for the length of this rant about ostensibly nothing, you've
been warned.)



Im not anti-shipping/anti-rps even if i take issue with them at times ik its
(mostly) self-contained and harmless plus we're all delusional and unethical at
times so who am i to judge LOL. but ngl for any rps ship once it gets popular
enough or their interactions become enthusiastic and frequent enough (government
ship status=permission to be batshit), the line between shipping and tin-hatting
blurs among shippers and suddenly the sustenance of the ship >>> everything
else, including the identities and potential/real feelings of the individuals
being shipped outside the context of the ship.



and i specify that last part because i think being a little dramatic on the tl
or crashing out about a potential change in their public dynamic, even if a
shallow/indulgent reading of a situation and incomprehensible to non-shippers,
is markedly different than some of the stuff i've seen insidiously assumed of
gw's actual personhood for uhhhhh bantering with a fan? favoring gf stans for a
few repos after a million times favoring mthw/shippers? being accused of hurting
mthw and feeding gf delusions, as if the inverse isnt feeding shipper delusions
lol? and suddenly his actions are insincere bc he MIGHT have a new limit or, you
know, enjoy entertaining two opposing audiences? (its hard to describe to people
not engaged in this but something like "doubting sincerity" can be said in a
matter-of-fact 4th-wall-breaking way or a rageful delusion-charged way and they
are NOT coming from the same place.)



and i get that it might have felt ""ooc"" but frankly gmg is now unprecedently
mainstream and occasionally viral which means more scrutiny, projection, and
entitlement from the most vocal gf stans and shippers, two sides of the same
coin (plus a lot of people are BOTH, the divide is overemphasized for
organizational and political reasons), which can accelerate change. and that's
not even accounting for just general judgement which is honestly a fair reason
to want to cut down on what they initially volunteered. and the chance of
consequences to their true off-cam dynamic and maybe professional lives also
rises (and yeah this applies to both gay AND straight ships, enough with that
whataboutism, there's nothing inherently brave or progressive about gay
shipping), which i imagine can kill the fun of it. if anything gmg fans have
been extremely spoiled bc gmg themselves like being crazy and thus they have
developed an expectation for constant and escalating fanservice that cant be as
mutually amusing for gmg overtime.



anyway this "shift" (which i feel funny saying bc it hasnt actually been long
enough to say has happened üòÇ) seems to have shocked shippers who tend to hang
in their little cliques and collectively burrow into their fantasies, but until
hype dies down gmg are no longer "performing" for a private in-group of
hyper-perceptive fans (they arguably never were but ik feeling like you're "in
on a secret" or "a part of the team" is the parasocial appeal of rps). that
should be obvious but ime rps fandoms skew young and slow-brained and interpret
things very literally which is unfortunate since engaging with rps in a
respectful AND still fun way requires more mindfulness than non-rps.



now while i dont doubt the controlling gf stans said some slick shit as always,
the hoopla of gw "conceding" to them is so overblown as of now and entirely
filtered through the shipper lens bc it was always clear that he was being at
least light-hearted if not outright joking? heres one video showing his
expression/tone, but it wasnt even needed imo:



https://x.com/sweety_bluerose/status/1910909567309152646?t=O2qg9JfmHWX9sU9mxDfTWg&s=19



so yeah nothing really new was learned but i just cant help but be bothered by
how the mere threat of potentially receiving less on-cam reactions resulted in
covert but genuine rage directed at the "threatening" party, and ofc it'll be
minimally acknowledged and become absorbed into the endless shipper vs gf stan
war, probably for the better but also #illneverforget. And we been knew this
ship is mthw-centric, the amount of pitiful emotions projected onto a fantasy
version of him and the lowkey condescending white-knighting over this is just
more evidence, but hey at least his "feelings" are considered at all.</p>

      <p><p>no sis UR COOKINGGGGGGGGG its rlly the fate of anything zroses get their hands on, they dont know a thing about enjoying ships the correct way.. as soon as mttwk was bigger than my backyard it was like the fans were on a campaign to make it weird ugh. </p><p></p><p>and thank you i knew better than to look for what ppls reactions were to that repo but it was actually shocking like.. ARE YALL FR RN üò≠?? wbk skryus are the bastards of the world but it rlly makes u think ab how the ship was bastardized from the very beginning just tools and satisfaction... or the fact that mttwk GWK ESPECIALLY was ever catering to them that still blows me HE DONT KNOW YALL</p><p></p><p>bgfhdjhgfdjsk its so easy for zroses to remain surface level dummies on anything if they make it all ab gf fans v shipper fans just no real thoughts going on over there ‚úåÔ∏è like hmmmm is it rlly so hard to consider personal feelings I GUESS NOT. but this is rlly the work of all this new attention and ur right gmg shippers are spoiled theyre mtt harem fans who discovered it in the last year to 6 months ago theyve never experienced poverty and took their entire relationship for granted. </p><p></p><p>and as annoying as i find gpds theres truth to their words nobody cares except for us üòë the ship was never balanced in terms of fans and it was so obvious a lot of the day to day gmg activities just included turning gwk into mtts slave it was so fucking annoying. and theyre also not wrong in being defensive any time gwk receives hate whether its from his own fans or trolls its basically doubling on the last time.. it literally never simmers down in a normal way and hes forced to see it always like just for the these ppl acted he shouldve cussed mtt out to that fan like UGH üòí</p><p></p><p>ive seen some defense for gwk in this whole &quot;sitch&quot; and literally none of it ackowledges the real issue and what happened were just stuck w moronic losers forever it seems..</p></p>

      <p>Lowkey related to this, as much as I hate w00ngdg5 and 4ll1n5 they are valid to
keep unc and hb from being shipped with mt. Most of mt ships are always infested
with skryus anyway. Skryus are bunch of useless sickos even the most normal
skryus are bunch of pick me attention seekers. For me, if the meek kult4r3s
don't even like it, idk, maybe reflect on yourself? Also I hate to guess a
person real personality based on how others behave, but there is this someone
whose fandom behave exactly like skryus and their idol behave exactly like mt.
All the fandom did is victimize the idol, ship them literally with everyone to
show how loved the idol is etc etc, even their idol is chronically online and
always know fans sentiment and use it to fuel fans rage. Or just do something
that could make people hating their coworker for something their rabid fans
write from own schizophrenic mind. Eventually, they got bad blood with one of
their commoner friend, this friend literally spill how they badmouth lots of
people even the ones heavily shipped with them. The worst part of all they turn
out to steal their friends' job often by sugarcoating the ceo, if they can't get
the job they beg the ceo reject it for others (must be the ceo sugarbby, that's
why the ceo always say yes). The fandom tried to refute by saying it was fake so
that idol rich fans were sending the chat proof to digital forensic service and
turns out everything is not tampered even when different service from different
countries were used lmao. I mean this case is common in celebrity world from the
most nugu to the most successful but all cases got one similarity</p>
