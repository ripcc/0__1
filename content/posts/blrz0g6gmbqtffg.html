      <p>explain more for auntie ðŸ˜­ i'm the auntie not you... if you've done any coding
in python before this should be pretty easy

another easier option is this chrome extension but i haven't tried it... but it
should clean up everything for you in a csv file that has the
questions/answers/dates/any other metadata neospring has for the answers in the
page (a csv file is kinda like an excel/google sheet, you can import it to
google sheets or excel and it'll be easier to search through your answers)

      <p>i ran the scraper for a minute and it scraped 245 questions

just some tips, for action to load more items select "scroll down to load more
items" and maybe try increasing the wait time to more than 5 seconds (maybe do
20seconds) bc neo is so slow. also sometimes neo glitches and doesn't scroll
down with the tool so you have to scroll down manually. if you see the start
scraping button that means it stopped but if you press it again it'll continue
adding to the page</p>

      <p>Anon from last time, I'm been a bit busy with school and now an internship, so
haven't had time to learn how to create a website from the json file. A website
would be easiest for general use, but information-wise a json should be good
enough for anyone who want to search for past asks. I actually adjusted my
script from webscrapping cc/rs and ran a script for ns as well to create a json,
though it's missing the reply timestamp in the json info. You could probably
convert the json to a csv with a bit of programming, but I found it easiest to
read in json format since paragraphs are harder to read</p>
