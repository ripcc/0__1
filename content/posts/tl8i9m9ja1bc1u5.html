      <p>I‚Äôm going to hate watch üò≠ i‚Äôm fiercely loyal to jb1, they are the only svs
group i‚Äôve ever stanned despite me watching the entire produce/planet series in
previous years and i‚Äôve pretty much given up on stanning any group post jb1 as
well because i‚Äôm too old for this shit now. it‚Äôs going to be fun comparing the
shows and final lineups but i don‚Äôt think they can top it lol and a lot of the
media play of this show is using jb1‚Äôs name. The nugu failed idols attending
mostly likely aren‚Äôt going to make it like hui and keita most people want fresh
faces in svs groups now</p>

      <p><p>LMAO it&apos;s true u rlly lose ppl with hate watching I think the biggest difference here is that this is the first time a bg season is happening while the previous bg is still around so who knows how it&apos;ll affect everything. ppl will have their depression hysteria for zbwon around the time the bg is set to debut so it&apos;s not like hearts will be easily moved but also svs change things idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è gwk rlly got lucky being my svs idol cuz the trauma will stick with me forever im never leaving him </p></p>
