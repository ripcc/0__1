      <p>why must the zrose life be so terrible like today with the micromanaging with
those bnb selfies and challenges (a small-ish thing but similar has happened
with them and other members), how their zbtv content is extremely hit or miss
(sorry, i felt like royalty with my other groups variety and it&#x27;s weird bc zbwon
are legit funny), they never do casual lives with each other etc etc meanwhile
all this shit is so easy to come by with every other group it really shouldn&#x27;t
be THAT hard to manage them. then you have how jw helped fuck everything up and
zroses being dumb and not focusing on the actual problems at hand like
idekkkkkkkk. LIKE IS THERE ANYTHING GOOD ACTUALLY HAPPENING HERE? okay they can
sing and the members are cute sometimes, what else ðŸ˜­ but also at the end of the
day i still love them despite everything being so awful? ðŸ˜­ i just wonder how
i&#x27;m even stanning bc it&#x27;s actually made me so miserable, mind you i was an armee
and the fans made it all so terrible and the fandom is now clearly the worst
it&#x27;s ever been yet this is still worse bc i guess the content we get from the
group doesn&#x27;t really make it better. despite all this, i just can&#x27;t stop being a
fan like i bleed blue bc i need to be there til the end. i think they actually
brainwashed me during bopeul bc something about that experience altered me
mentally fr</p>

      <p><p>a blood curse was put on us that&apos;s the only explanation I have never in my life stuck through misery for a group like this ðŸ˜­ it&apos;s insane their issues are quite literally the simplest kpop fixes THATS THE MOST IRKSEOM PART AB EVERYTHING I FEEL LIKE IM AB TO THROW A TANTRUMMMM what crimes did we commit to deserve thisssssssss. but exactly we&apos;re slaves to them cuz im still staying idgaf we gave our hearts to them we gots to see it through ðŸ˜« they&apos;ve truly invented a new strain of slopstanning we might have it worse than schizophrenic carti fans who waited 5 years through lies and deceit to get his mid album HVNMDMFNFMKFMFM IT FEEL LIKE WE STANNING A SPORTS TEAM WE MAD AT SOMETIMES I just hope when the cb trailer comes out we get memory loss and snap into glaze mode we deserve to be dumb and happy </p></p>
