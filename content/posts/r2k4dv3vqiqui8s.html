      <p>I am sorry no matter how popular zh and yj are, how much of an stan attractor
rik can be, I just don&#x27;t see yhz reaching their full potential. At best they
will have some debut hit like y3na had with smile or 3verglow had with bon bon
chocolat but then yh will do something to fuck them up. They stress me out sooo
bad.</p>

      <p>this is where it gets tricky cuz yena is a soloist so its hard to compare and
everglow not even that popular in kr like yhz and what yrn did kinda fucked them
up but we know yh can somehow make hits just dont know how to handle them this
will be their first popular bg too so im scared ðŸ¥¶ðŸ˜Ÿ</p>
