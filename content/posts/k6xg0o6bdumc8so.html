Maybe it&#x27;s possible I liked him; he&#x27;s exactly the same as he was pre-debut. I
was confused when he appeared in the bp because he was acting like someone else.
His habits really match with ADHD - he zones out sometimes. His co-star even
told him, &#x27;Hyung, you&#x27;re doing too much&#x27; and am definitely sure he is not normal
