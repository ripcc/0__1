long story short the company scheduled an interview since people were up in arms
about hrbz missing and hb was the one answering the questions but heâ€™s getting
dragged for his answers. to me he was clearly told to avoid specifics so it
makes sense he would be vague. people are also mad that they didnâ€™t include some
reference to hrbz in the group pic and blaming him for that too</p>
