      <p>i’m feeling hopeful about camp jbw 2 again because based on their messages i
think this is the week they’re filming the music video and possibly album jacket
shoot so the schedule out in the wild might actually be reality content</p>

      <p>diff anon but same, the way they&#x27;re talking this week is actually giving mv
filming compared to that receptionless filming + yj and gw sending old selfies
today (either to hide hair colors or just mv outfits ig. or nothing lmaoooo)

the one thing that sounded odd to me was mt saying the director woke him up bc
he kept falling asleep on set but ig that&#x27;s posible for camp jbw too</p>
