      <p>the lack of zb1 content is so ridiculous like does the company not realise we&#x27;re
on a time limit? they very easily could&#x27;ve filmed some zbtving, zbtv or zb1
folder videos in the past few months but with the way things are moving i doubt
that&#x27;s happened, all they do is film brand deals or solo photoshoots and then we
have to live off a stale 5 to 10 minute behind the scenes zepisode where the
whole group doesn&#x27;t even interact. group shit should be the priority because
it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re still gonna get it in a year&#x27;s time, this is quite literally
the only chance except for the extremely rare variety show cast crossover. you
have groups who have a full normal 7 year content doing group activities 24/7
with a solo gig sprinkled in occasionally and yet here&#x27;s zb1, a group with less
than a year left, doing the complete opposite. who gaf about serving akgaes omg
JUST ACT LIKE A GROUP, YOU&#x27;RE SUPPOSED TO BE A GROUP</p>
