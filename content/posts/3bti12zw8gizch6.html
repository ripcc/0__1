      <p>iirc jao once mentioned in an interview that he decided to sign with them bc
they promised that they&#x27;d debut him but they ended up putting him a bplanet so i
guess it makes sense that his contract is shorter than the rest?</p>

      <p><p>a promise is diff than on paper but idk I doubt that they&apos;d make him sign anything less than 5-6 yrs even if that was the case</p></p>

      <p>i&#x27;m lowkey not sure why everyone&#x27;s doubting this because it really is common
knowledge if you kick it with crosins especially the hardcore ones lmao his
contract isn&#x27;t even an artist contract it&#x27;s like 3 years i think</p>

      <p>idk if its the same in jao&#x27;s case but project groups&#x27; members usually only
signed the trainee contract with their OG companies thats why they could debut
under a different company for a certain period of time because signing the
artist contract(5-7years) under two diff companies dont seem possible (thats why
wj/sn and un/iq didnt work, the members ended up staying only in one company)</p>

      <p><p>this my first svs so I&apos;m not sure but I was under the impression they mainly sign artist contracts once they&apos;re formed but maybe not ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”</p></p>

      <p>i dont think its the regular artist contract. after izwon disbanded, hype tried
to recruit min.ju but she refused and chose to stay with her OG agency because
she wanted to be an actress whereas there were sak.ura and chae.won who decided
to leave their OG agencies for hype so i guess unlike the 5-7years regular
contract where they have no choice but to stick with the agency until the
contract ends, they&#x27;re given more freedom (in a sense that they did not have to
pay penalty fee) to choose whether they want to continue with the OG agencies or
not after the project group&#x27;s contract ends.



also for reference, during wanna1, dan.iel and ji.sung were under the same
agencies (MMO) and their exclusive contracts with their OG agencies ended on jan
31 (same day as wanna1&#x27;s contract ended) and then they resigned the regular
5-7-year-contract in february (which then kdn had a legal dispute with his
agency)



so basically if jao&#x27;s/jb1 member&#x27;s contract is the same previous project groups&#x27;
members&#x27;, then their exclusive contract with their OG agencies will end on the
same day as their jb1&#x27;s contract ends too.</p>

      <p>we also have to keep in mind that every company will have different contracts.
like the akbee48 girls definitely didn&#x27;t have the same contract as the korean
trainees. minj came from an actor company so she didn&#x27;t have a typical idol
contract. i read on a ns that hbn might have a different one too because when
ravee set up his company he didn&#x27;t want to do typical idol contracts like people
were surprised at how free he runs the company. i don&#x27;t have hope for jllyfish
and gw&#x27;s future is so unpredictable. they&#x27;re a more established company so i
feel like they have their contracts on lock plus since they manage evnn they&#x27;re
not broke broke</p>

      <p><p>yea their contracts prob vary a lot but for jf mmm idk they stated there was no plans for a bg a week before finale which i think it was a scare tactic but also theres some truth in it considering theyve shown 0 signs of acknowledging gwk or planning a group. they manage evn but it feels like it just serves as a placeholder company for yh and wkn ugh idk theyre so garbage I WANT OUT!!!!</p></p>

      <p>eh i just want to correct but mintjoo&#x27;s agency was not an exclusively actor
agency tho? she was originally under urban works which was an agency for singer
called kriesha chu and they used to have plenty kpop trainees</p>
