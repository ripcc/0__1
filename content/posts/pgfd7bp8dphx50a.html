      <p>I swear, most streams were probably from jzeroses. I&#x27;m on stationhead and
majority are jzeroses parking their accounts too. Whenever I see jfans getting
the good stuff, I understand since jzeroses works hard. They even donated for
the Korean promo blue when they barely even finished now or never promos. It
sucks since jebis should focus more in Korean markets but Japan market is pretty
big too. I know fans are upset since jebis have such a short time left but
wakeone will milk wherever they can get</p>
