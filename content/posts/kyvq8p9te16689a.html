      <p>it lowkey pisses me off bc i fear i will not be since bp was the first survival
show i ever cared about in terms of voting and bc of the state of music in the
industry and zbwon draining the life from me, i'm way less into kpop. like i
just cannot get myself to gaf about groups anymore and the stress of a survival
show isn't worth it like zbwon may as well have given me depression LMAOOOOOOO
but i just know all these other zroses are talking all this trash only to
abandon zbwon hard when b2p comes out as all survival show group stans do
meanwhile i have zbwon strapped to my chest like a b*mb 😭 disbandment is also
gonna annoy me so bad bc survival show group stans always talk about missing the
group they stanned and wonder what the idols are up to when it's so easy to keep
up with a group casually like just follow them on social media and you'll know
what's going on lmao? it's partly your fault they're nugus now??? idk i just
hate the fickleness and fakeness, i feel like the wendy williams video where
she's like "SO WHY DON'T YOU BUY HER MUSIC?"</p>
