      <p>for context the fan asked him &quot;i have an age gap with you of 8 years what are
you okay with either way&quot; so he answered with their difference I don&#x27;t think the
fan specified if they were older or younger though. i feel sometimes he caters
too much to fans he&#x27;ll really say anything but yep i also remember this on twt</p>
