      <p>Iâ€™ve been keeping up with like all of the recent boy group survival shows and I
have 2 contestants I think would do well in boys planet 2 if they show up. Seo
Yundeok (hot + really good and goofy personality + unique looking but in a
memorable way + can perform + solid fanbase (eliminated last episode of his
survival show MakeMate so he has some fans already)) and Seok June (looks like
Juyeon but younger and dare I say more natural + face carddd + can dance + was
like one of the top runners of his show and most people watched it for him ðŸ˜­
(he was part of the starship boy group survival show but left for some reason
like two weeks ago) + words cannot state how important he was, his teaser got
like 2 million views on Twitter and there have been petitions since he left for
starship to force him back in - itâ€™s sort of nuts ðŸ˜…. These two, out of everyone
Iâ€™ve seen across like 7 recent-ish survival shows, have the highest chance of
actually becoming someone if they do pull up to BP2. Just wanted to put them on
your radar. Theyâ€™re both born in 2005/06 respectively so theyâ€™re at a good age.
Itâ€™d also make me laugh if Seok June applied for it in March (since March 23rd
2025 was the last day for K-Group first applicantion rounds) and the second he
learned he advanced he left the Starship show knowing heâ€™d be stuck in Cravity
#2 if he didnâ€™t do better ðŸ˜­</p>
