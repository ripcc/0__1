      <p>anon... his own fans sued ktkt thats how bad it was ðŸ˜­ ktkt sent him to shanghai
the richest business province in china only to put him in a budget hotel where
he had to live stream in the bathroom cause theres no tables, advertised as a
private fanmeet but last minute announced that the fanmeet was gonna be public
in a mall with randos after paying $$$ but now anyone can see him for free,
fans/ fansites got doxxed and ktkt invited a bunch random influencers to sit
front row for free which got him into so many dating influencer scandals because
ppl were like wait why are they there it gotta be some personal connections ðŸ˜­
it was bad</p>
