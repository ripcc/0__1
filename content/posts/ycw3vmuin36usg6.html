      <p>I think someone spread the wrong info about this being akaraka the one they&#x27;re
attending is yonseis anniversary festival akaraka is yonseis prestigious
festival and that ones line up is never revealed till the day of the festival
and it&#x27;s usually only super popular idols</p>

      <p>ummm anons got a point theres definitely a gap in hype and budget between the
two events but they are both akaraka. â€˜akarakaâ€™ is more hyped cuz their cheer
squad hosted it for undergraduates while the student council hosted â€˜akaraka
alumniâ€™ the one zbwon performed at for graduates and alumni. but nothing matters
cuz did you see how happy they all are? can other universities invite them too
pleaseee they are great performerssss they can perform your cheer song too!!!</p>

      <p>trust we got it, it&#x27;s the implication that jebes couldnt get invited to a
prestig festival is what&#x27;s annoyingðŸ˜‚ anyway iirc univ festival season has ended
now but there&#x27;s also the winter ones. if it&#x27;s in the winter, jebes will probably
be busy with the tour and all so &lt;///3 wkone is so stupid jebes were literally
free FREE throughout this univ festival season(april-may) but of course they&#x27;d
rather accept the chopped festival than sending them to local univ festivals
which actually could give them a good publicity (dont try to argue about them
not getting invited because even isna or encity wizh with 0 hit song got invited
to uni festivals. its 100% on wkone&#x27;s bad management)</p>
