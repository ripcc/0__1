      <p>Ok but this really makes me wonder not just for this event but in general yh
obviously put a lot of effort in zh in terms of exposure and opportunities and
thatâ€™s completely fine like they should they are his company but that makes me
question how true the rumours about him wanting to leave or having a very short
contract are because thereâ€™s no way on earth dh is popping her back like this if
heâ€™s really leaving after disbandment</p>
