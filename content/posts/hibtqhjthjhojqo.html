      <p>saw in another mond someone share that apparently a student zrose from weibo
said that mt, rk, gw and tr favour certain fans (it said &quot;paid fans in the
fancon&quot; so i assume they mean the ones they always see at fancalls/fansigns)
which is shocking for me with some of those members (and by that i mean mt and
gw).. like i get going all out or being surprised to see those fans in person at
the concert but if they&#x27;re like completely neglecting and not interacting with
the more normal/less rich fans who only go to the fancon then that&#x27;s not the
greatest ðŸ˜ž i wanna know more about that and other members interactions with
fans/personalities tho tbhhhhh</p>

      <p><p>usually these things are way more credible with multiple anecdotes over time idt they favor rich fans and neglect everyone else mtt and gwk esp are known for their crazy good service ðŸ˜­ i saw so many fans get interactions from the fancon like fanpages with 0 followers type shit i think its fine if they look out for their fansites cuz they definitely do but i dont think its that bad. speaking from my own experience at gayo i watched gwk looking for his fansites but he waved at anyone who shouted his name too lol</p></p>
