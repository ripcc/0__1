      <p>i remember seeing a discussion in moon&#x27;s mond that apparently rav1 made it easy
for his artists to leave the company (i guess bc he&#x27;s been an idol so he knows
how it is. also idk the specifics of that since the anon never elaborated but i
wish i did so if anyone knows... lemme know) so it&#x27;d be funny if he gagged us at
the last minute and actually just up and left and debuted somewhere else even
tho i find that extremely unlikely given b4da being there and everything</p>
