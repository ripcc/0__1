      <p><p>#HEWOULD yknow the more i think about it the more i can understand gyv oops 😂 hes just very shameless and unaware so he moves in an unclassy way but having someone be the older sibling u never had will change ur bitchass lifeeeeeee but the pr beginnings just throw everything off gjfkighfejrghj hbn def feeds into it too thus making it bigger just so boymomish</p></p>

      <p>honestly i can’t see zhg and gyv bond over anything other than their shared
h4nbin obsession sdfghjjk and i wonder what it is about him that makes some ppl
obsess over him like gyv be acting like he found the long lost brother he’s
never had and if u know the wechat lore zhg went crazy for him like he’s never
done before for a bf</p>

      <p>TEA this is actually fascinating to me, especially with jao because gyv is just
a tweaker in general tbh. But knowing he was well liked but seen as sort of cold
and unapproachable somewhat (even with his responses and blank pfp) and then
suddenly doing all that on Wechat after knowing hbn for 4/5 months is crazyyyyy
like he really put some spell on him</p>
