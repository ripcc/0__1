      <p>soz if this is a sensitive topic for others but i just saw 2 tweets from within

butt zh - starving for 3 whole days before cb showcase - and hb&#x27;s - the whole
weighing everyday as a trainee thing - weight &#x27;concerns&#x27; are and it just has me

      <p>IT IS PRETTY AVERAGE but idk something about it made me go &quot;oh ðŸ˜•&quot; because with
the hb thing it reminded me of how yuq1 said in cub3 they made her like the
standard for weight, would shame trainees for gaining weight by printing out
hers and putting it on the office buildings walls and then with zh he was
talking about a specific number of kgs so i was just reminded of the severity of
it and these bits of info coming out within such a short time of each other so i
was just like &quot;DAMN&quot;</p>

      <p><p>woah? Okay that sounds traumatizing but I feel like they drop weight stuff pretty often was it ftp? I&apos;m p sure zgh was talking ab dropping a number of kgs for it I guess it&apos;s just jarring to hear it be talked ab so normally </p></p>

      <p>they&#x27;re probably just used to it tbh

when it&#x27;s part of your job it just becomes normal. it&#x27;s just not normal to us
because we don&#x27;t do stuff like that</p>
