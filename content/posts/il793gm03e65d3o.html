      <p>From what I remembered, zb1 started posting member covers on their birthdays
starting with taerae. So naturally, Matthew, Ricky and hanbins birthdays didnt
get anything. If they notice it, here&#x27;s the released order members did for their
birthdays



Taerae - eclipse song cover

Hao - feel special song cover

Gyuvin - dance cover wolves x maverick

Jiwoong - self written song

Gunwook - self written song placebo

Yujin - song cover tsuki



Matthew, Ricky and hanbin are the only ones who didn&#x27;t do it because it only
started after taeraes birthdays. If they&#x27;re complaining about covers in general,
then yes it&#x27;s valid since Matthew and hanbin did get to release song covers on
different occasions (non-birthday event).</p>
