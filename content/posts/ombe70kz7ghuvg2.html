      <p>ðŸ¤” I considered Gvn as leader before as Yjn is prob the new center and
Rky....nah sorry Rky fans. And yh ain&#x27;t gonna be putting newbies to boss over
debuted idols their fans will riot..... Gvn tweaks over Hbn a bit too much for
my liking but he&#x27;s someone which I feel will bring the grp together and take
care of all members and listen to them and cry with them as the big dependable
older brother.



Coming back to Gvn tweaking over Hbn, I wonder if Hbn has been teaching him
leadership 101 (being kpop grp leaders is a job in itself) that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s
grateful. Why do I feel like Hbn will get midnight calls from a crying Gvn
saying how did u make it after yhz redebut</p>
