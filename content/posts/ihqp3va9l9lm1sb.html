      <p>maybe ricky will pick acting after zb1 heâ€™s the type to get into whatever he
wants and would pursue it, ive seen recent fancalls and its like the third time
in heâ€™s mentioned wanting to do it ðŸ˜­ like he seems really enthusiastic ab it he
said he wanted to do a villain role well good fpr him he can do the villain guy
that doesnâ€™t gets the girl id want that ngl ðŸ˜­ im actually looking forward
hopeeee yuehua gets him into those acting jobs, i see winwin and jun doing
pretty well maybe he can get some of that ðŸ˜­ damn im so in it ill even watch his
flop dramas and shit storylines</p>

      <p>nah he got shat on bad they kept saying his head is big, bad body proportions,
looks evil, green card traitor, looks like he&#x27;s raised by triads because of his
piercings and tattoos, leech (this is from crosins), looks like he belongs in a
peking opera because of his thick makeup etc... these comments weren&#x27;t even from
rosin akgaes or c kpop akgaes it was from the general public who watched running
man and their first impression of him. his response on douyin was good on the
other hand but that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re more young and know about kpop but
everywhere else was pretty bad. cent is just evil and will work him dry, gonna
make him weigh 80lbs because all male actors are sickly stick thin and will
control him wayyy more than wk1 for whatever image they want to push on him and
don&#x27;t get me started on the political stance bullshit that will make him lose
all his kfans and even ifans.</p>

      <p>it was simply because his name tag was his english name ðŸ’€ while I&#x27;m at it don&#x27;t
even get me started on cent stalking culture... if you think k sasaengs are bad
c sasaengs are cracked up unhinged x100. they actually believe they own whoever
they&#x27;re stalking and still expect them to be friendly with them after
terrorizing them because they &#x27;owe&#x27; the c sasaengs for their time waiting for
them... bruh. they also aren&#x27;t afraid to berate and curse at them in front of
their own face and post it online and fuckass commenters would be like &#x27;aw look
at him looking all sad, you should scold him more! I love seeing this side of
him!&#x27; encouraging the sasaengs behaviour... actual freaks.



and this already happened with him. in late 2023 when he wouldn&#x27;t look at the c
sasaeng because they were umm... STALKING him they cursed at him in front of
everyone at the airport saying they were going to un stan him. yeah no thanks
keep that shit away from him.</p>
