      <p>i tried to find it before i sent the text but its hard to find.. i tried the
usual search prevention stuff like just the initials, i only found jao&#x27;s dcgall
and its literally named after a food and they call him &quot;long&quot; i didn&#x27;t realize
they took search prevention that far on that site its crazy sjfhdskfjh</p>

      <p>jao&#x27;s gall has things they get upset about too but only on certain topics (this
is a while back but if you remember kfan tweak about the h4ndong challenge they
were tweakinggg then) and the admin deletes things very fast so you have to be
watching the gall to see. his is nice though sometimes they hold bracket
competitions at night for stuff like best selfie, best airport pic.</p>
