      <p>curious about chanel&#x27;s opinion about jao attending gcci26 cruise because from
last year she said it&#x27;s possible unc and janbin were invited and couldn&#x27;t attend
due to schedule conflicts (or more like agreeing akgaes/solos words) but it&#x27;s
less likely for jao to be invited and look at what happened now lol.</p>

      <p>Leekn*w isnâ€™t a BA and w1nter went to the 24 cruise and had a long term
relationship with them but was never a BA. Ryuj1n went too and sheâ€™s not a BA.
Itâ€™s not necessarily the case if they only invite potentially BAs.</p>
