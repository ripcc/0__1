      <p>Speaking of new fans I lost the tweets so maybe someone else has it someone
finally called it out (granted it was about a recent incident for hbn) but
there‚Äôs a group of newer fans that do so much sexualising of the boys it‚Äôs
actually crazy and people don‚Äôt call it out before. Not like the regular Stan
finding them sexy but like talking about sexual stuff or dick sizes or graphic
scenes all written out on main and they get thousands of likes and then wonder
why people view zerose the way they do üò≠</p>
