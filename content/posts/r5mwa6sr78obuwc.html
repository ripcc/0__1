      <p>Tbh it depends on whose fans are lucky enough to make up the majority. Like yes
most fans there are solos but they are only going to outright ignore the ones
they hate not those they just dgaf about. I also wonder how skipping in this
sort of fs work like wasnâ€™t it a high wave ? How does one skip during an in
person album signing.</p>

      <p><p>yea the difference between the first fansign and your fansign was because of the fans who won most members have gained more fans so it shouldn&apos;t be too bad but it still might be a lil awk. and I think it was just the fact that some members literally had to sit and awkwardly watch everyone during photo time it was so harddddd to see those videos ðŸ˜­</p></p>

      <p>hbn was beside zhg i don&#x27;t think he was intentionally being skipped but all
their attention was just on zhgðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i saw xhs posts of new solo zhg fans asking
advice abt fansigns bcs they dont have anything to say to other members but are
required to do it and comments said they just sell their slot and ask a question
to the member in behalf of that person</p>
