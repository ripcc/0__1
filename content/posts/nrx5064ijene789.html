      <p>lmao it&#x27;s actually so funny because a lot of 0s were so damn surprised about
this and blamed people for not calling them out sooner except every damn hbinst
did because of how much they&#x27;d cut out zh and not mention his name or even blur
him but were disregarded as stupid delusional shippers.. like ok lol</p>
