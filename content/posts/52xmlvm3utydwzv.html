      <p>Also people fail to consider that itâ€™s not about visas or permission like yes
chn people can still go, c fans still went but with how much the situation
worsened this week alone (and Iâ€™m talking chn putting nuk3s really close to tw)
ofc public figures are going to have to be weary about where they go and what
they do especially when anything could break out at any second. I also think
itâ€™s ignorant when fans say chn wouldnâ€™t go to war with tw because they consider
it part of chn, like thatâ€™s exactly why they would go to war ðŸ˜­ they want to be
1 but tw doesnâ€™t. Look at ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° and ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ both fight over Kashmir which they both
claim as their own but have no bother about using it as a battleground</p>

      <p>let me just ask you guys why China would try to be more aggressive after just
settling the tariffs situation and why a white American is the one announcing
and accusing China of preparing to invade Taiwan, with some bullshit like &quot;we
know they&#x27;re preparing troops and to invade by 2027&quot;? It is America being an
aggressor again after their tariffs stunt failed.</p>
