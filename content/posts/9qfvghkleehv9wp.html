      <p>i am 100% sure the only reason weekone didn't promote zeebee as a group is
because of yh, because looking at issna's content they certainly know how to
promote a group as a group, yh is planning since the debut how to divide the
group fan since a lot of them will stay with yhz since they are from the same
company</p>

      <p><p>..ur almost there ðŸ˜­ no its because isna are permanent and wkn artists and zbwon arent. their entire purpose is to go back to where they came from so group priority isnt as serious as a wkn group would be. i will say tho that isna wouldnt be having this if they debuted at the same time as zbwon there were so many mistakes that were made simply cuz wkns trash to the point yh helped a bit so err not rlly cuz at the end of the day this hurts yh too </p></p>

      <p>the idea of wki learning from the mistakes they made for the jebes to promote
the new bp2 group better or as a group makes me wanna kms omg i hope their
fandom is also filled with akgaes and terrorism so wki just treats them like 8
soloists too now ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’</p>
