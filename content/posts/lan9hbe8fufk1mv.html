      <p>Out of topic but i feel like for regular sponsorship with no titles whatsoever
brands just reach out for the group then their stylist just dress up the ones
whose most fitting for example we found out in salon drip that calvin klein were
sponsoring the entire zbwon but only 2 of them took pics for ck on ig</p>
