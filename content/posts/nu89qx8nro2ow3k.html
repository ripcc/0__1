      <p>Isn&#x27;t noyb chinese? I saw an anon the other day say she mistranslated the

      <p>she always talks abt making her dad get stuff for her when theres pop ups in
shanghai so she must have moved here for school or smthn and then stayed did u
see the ris airing their grievances abt her using translate in ryangi opps nsðŸ˜­
she wants to control the narrative so bad but u can tell most of his dedicated
fans have silently figured it out by now these days the tweets i see abt rky
being banned mostly come from gyubrkers lol</p>
