      <p>apparently he said &#x27;I havent been able to come for a while because I was
preparing for this kind of stage&#x27;? like it gotta be about his pc right? he hasnt
been on there for over 2weeks (came last night) and about how the members can
come but you couldnt ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ idk if it was ending ment or midway ment but
he said it and idt its him mocking kfans? i think it him mocking riyangis and
ris with the pc ban bullshit and admitted he didnt come because he was busy and
not because of a ban ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­</p>

      <p>its me im the same anon who sent og ask and the link lol sorry queef and other
anons ill work harder on expressing myself properly ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ but i was
basically trying to say wow rick finally admitted and owned up to pc being
completely on him and crazy he did it at their korean fancon in front of
everyone so hes putting an end to ris and riyangi pc ban propaganda ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ but
hypocrite of riyangis and ris to not translate it (if there is a clip BUT THERES
GOTTA BE A CLIP ESP IF ITS A MENT SO THEY HYPOCRITES I KNOW RIYANGIS AND RIS SAW
THAT SHIT) and its even more important cus he said it in korean so hes probably
kinda saying sorry to rukidans and finally taking accountability and
acknowledging them ğŸ˜­ cus in the link comment i sent u rukidans were like how
lame he said it at the fancon LOOL



like hey maybe that riyangi opp and her hashtags got to him ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­</p>
