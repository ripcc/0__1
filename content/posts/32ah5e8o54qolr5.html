      <p>Pretty sure it’s for the Gucci cruise show in Florence. Fashion week starts in
June so if he’s flying in may it’s literally impossible for it to be for fashion
week. Though flight leaks on xhs say he’s flying to Germany? Which makes no
sense because there are flights from Seoul to Milan and a stop Over in Germany
makes no sense</p>
