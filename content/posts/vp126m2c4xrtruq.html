      <p>Iâ€™m tryna figure out what the stages are because lkyz hinted at a duo stage and
other members like rk / hb have hinted at solo stages too. Iâ€™m guessing since
itâ€™s a fancon and not concert they wonâ€™t be performing a big amount of their own
discography. All I can guess is that maybe since itâ€™s the 2 year anniversary
they might do a mashup of the audition stages ? Where they only perf a little
bit each, I canâ€™t imagine how full songs would work for jw tr and gw. Also yhz
stage would just make the yhz fans even more demonic and Iâ€™m not ready to deal
with their increased schizophrenia for another 9 months.</p>
