      <p>Diffrent anon but on this topic i remember around late sept we were predicting
if anyone heâ€™d be the one whoâ€™d probably go on a break from burnout and yk
despite being insanely busy (touch wood) weâ€™ve gone this whole contract period
so far without anyone needing time off</p>

      <p>It was an arm splint I think he hurt his wrist at that time, we only found out
cuz one of his classmates posted a pic of him at uni with it on and then he
didnâ€™t wear the brace to the airport but had this massive bruise on his hand.
The razor one must have been deep tho because it was bandaged for like 2 weeks.
