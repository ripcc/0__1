      <p>Slightly off topic but I’m already seeing rsns already tweaking at the thought
of members having solos stages ( I think it’s mainly because it’s heavily hinted
lkyz are doing a duo stage) but icl id be happy with duo and solo stages too
it’s nice to see a variety of new performances especially for something like a
fancon</p>
