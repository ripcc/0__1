      <p>Oh sponsoring perfumes for his bday cafe is cool, also I think the perfume bday
cafe was a cool ideas. Thatâ€™s the thing with smaller brands is if they work well
with you it can rally be a good tie, like hapa kristen? The contacts brand, they
were built up to what they are now through w0ny and sheâ€™s practically the face
of their brand and it was a gamble since they were a much smaller brand when she
started working with them but long term itâ€™s been such a good partnership for
both parties</p>

      <p>the thing with w0ny is she already has a really god rep/ established herself in
the industry so the brand, even newer ones would be extra careful and make sure
everything they do with her is 110%

but rk isn&#x27;t established yet so ktkt just did w.e with him to see what works,
like they tried to make it work with the whole being cool by interacting and
replying to fans but they did wayyy too much where they were replying to
everything single fan who @ them and just made them look unprofessional and now
we know they just cheap in general so it sucks</p>
