      <p>oh a lot of them are mad trust me jdjdjt ðŸ˜­ they're either avoiding the lukyz
stage like the plague or rting one post and calling it a day and saying why
didn't zgh get a solo stage girl you dgaf you wouldn't be saying that if it was
a jaobin stage lol besides most of them call duos of jao/janbin with other
members pushed and fake sooooo it's not a shocker</p>
