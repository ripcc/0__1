      <p>4.4k likes and it being joked about.... well i guess the elephant in the room
isn&#x27;t really being ignored now ğŸ¤” i do wonder how many ppl knew but just never
acknowledged it bc they didn&#x27;t wanna be jumped by wdg/zrose or shit like that bc
i don&#x27;t wanna believe that that many ppl can&#x27;t put 1 + 1 together (still can&#x27;t
get over ppl making up dorm scenarios involving him in their head and tweeting
it out like ğŸ˜‚ guys ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚)
