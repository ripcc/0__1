      <p>with wake1 giving us absolutely 0 zbwon anything other than merch and shitty
zepisodes i wonder if right when they&#x27;re supposed to disband there will be a
short contract extension that&#x27;s kinda supposed to be inferred as like &quot;hey guys,
we see you really want to still see the members together and we feel you so
we&#x27;re giving you this gift xx&quot; in order to try and get in everyone&#x27;s good graces
meanwhile everyone is just gonna be fed up as FAWK by then</p>
