      <p>just want to add that jungti refers to the styling more than the behaviour and
jungnam(chinese man) in korean is actually seen a positive thing unlike
hannam(lit. korean man but also means incel).



i can totally understand why anon feels that way and idk if this explanation can
make you feel better about it but language is contextual and in this context,
this term is used out of love (you may watch youtuber yeo dano&#x27;s content to
understand about this jungti term more since she kinda made it a thing)</p>
