      <p>Ok same person as yesterday little review today

The mood was definitely a lot better it took some time for the crowd and the
boys to warm up they still seemed a bit nervous at the beginning but it
definitely got better quickly. I&#x27;d you guys thought I was exaggerating about
kick it ruining the night yesterday for a lot of the crowd during prerec they
asked the crowd about kick it and everyone was like.......Dhdhdkdjdjdkod

They sang more live today I feel I could hear more mistakes but that&#x27;s not a bad
thing I loved it definitely upped the energy quite a bit again some of the solos
weren&#x27;t too good ESP gyuv like noticeably lacking and I forgot yuj and jiwung so
it must not be too good as well but the rest esp gunuk hb and jao were sooo good
it made me forget, the final note on love wins all resonated so weel like he was
SINGING the boys also interacted with each other a lot more the lack of
interactions both with each other and the crowd yesterday was weird hmmm blue
and crush are a lot more fun live

It definitely felt more like a concert than a fancon I personally don&#x27;t see the
use of 9 solos for a fancon? But it was much more satisfactory and enjoyable
today, the crowd also felt lighter and happier by the end</p>
