      <p>i didn't want to say anything about this but anons really love to talk, alins
aren't going to spend money for something which has no direct benefit to him
except for some publicity when the bday gifts and ads they arranged are much
greater than last year, also the way alins voting power increased this year, i
doubt his fanbase has decreased. also he would need to sell 80k+ to surpass rk
which is kind of pointless, he is not chinese, he doesn't need to show his
selling power to gain leverage among his peers which infact zgh and rk
constantly would need to do if they shifted to chinese market.</p>
