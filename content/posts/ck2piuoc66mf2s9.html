      <p>Hmm maybe or maybe not,

In her case zbone will still be active while this new bg gets made and possibly
debuts so she will still have things to update for them. And if you follow her
insta she follows so many groups and goes to their shit it’s just that he x is
for zbone so there’s a chance she will still follow members but if she likes the
new bg make it an update account for them, or if it doesn’t hit just keep it as
a zbone update account or solo</p>
