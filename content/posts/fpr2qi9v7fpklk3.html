      <p>my hatred for him always blinded me but tbh i do believe he is SOMEWHAT
neurodivergent. i dont think ive seen an idol so unaware of social cues before.
i dont think hes even an attention seeker when he does weird dances i think he
just does it off a impulse. like the angdkjeong thing i feel he doesnt think
about reprucussions as easily. might sound like im coddling a grown man but just
my observation</p>

      <p><p>hes genuinely puzzling at times i rmbr someone did a longgg analysis on him back on cc cuz theyve known and liked him for yrs and they cooked smth is not right up there.. but idt it can be heavily attributed like that tho. hes def aware of his actions and the repercussions the way he acted most of last yr was accordingly but recently he just doesnt seem to gaf anymore and seems very last ditch effort desperate since the climate arounds him calmed down and theyre ending soon but i think he does feel positibe towards the group and fans. hes just entitled thats why theres no apology thats why he feels no guilt thats why he doesnt mind using the members thats why gets the resources thats why he feels like the fans are also there for him (outside of his own) ugh lemme not go on a tangent but hes.. special</p></p>
