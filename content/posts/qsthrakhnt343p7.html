      <p>curious about chanel&#x27;s opinion about jao attending gcci26 cruise because from
last year she said it&#x27;s possible unc and janbin were invited and couldn&#x27;t attend
due to schedule conflicts (or more like agreeing akgaes/solos words) but it&#x27;s
less likely for jao to be invited and look at what happened now lol.</p>

      <p>anon thinks they ate with the lol in the end. chanelcrocs is not a fortune
teller. jao had no proper business with gucci before this, you cant really blame
her for thinking whatever she did. huayue pulled some good strings for jao since
they want him to stay</p>
