      <p>Gw just need a trigger to be competitive again like he was during BoysPlanet. He
was being comfortable for too long and doing charity too much it dies down his
charm. It is a good thing other members got much gigs he might snap out of it.
Worse case he might changed his life path after disbandment. His noonas need to
stop babying him and start to know when to give stick or carrot. Them rarely
stand up to protect him enough also play a role in shaping his mind, how he
never feel safe to release content out of plscht so it rarely reach wider
audience!</p>
