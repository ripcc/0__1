he just be saying anything sometimes like wdym you don&#x27;t do fanservice that&#x27;s
literally your job as an idol? ðŸ˜­ maybe he meant well and couldn&#x27;t express
himself properly but this kind of talk just blurs all kinds of boundaries that
should be set between fans (gf stans/shippers etc) and the idol, like at the end
of the day doing fanservice doesn&#x27;t mean your love for your fans isn&#x27;t genuine??</p>
