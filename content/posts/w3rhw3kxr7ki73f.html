he just be saying anything sometimes like wdym you don't do fanservice that's
literally your job as an idol? ðŸ˜­ maybe he meant well and couldn't express
himself properly but this kind of talk just blurs all kinds of boundaries that
should be set between fans (gf stans/shippers etc) and the idol, like at the end
of the day doing fanservice doesn't mean your love for your fans isn't genuine??</p>
