      <p>acting like his fans aren&#x27;t gonna respond when he gets talked about ðŸ˜­ i know
some of them like to complain but let&#x27;s not act like he doesn&#x27;t get shitted on
and shaded by many of ur anons too it&#x27;s only normal that u expect his fans to be
schizophrenic in ur inbox in return just like others</p>
