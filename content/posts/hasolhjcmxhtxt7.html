      <p>H@knyeon saying heâ€™s innocent and getting into a legal battle with his company
and news outlets for allegedly misreporting prost!tution is insane. If he is
telling the truth (on the slight chance) then I feel horrible for him. If heâ€™s
lying, he needs to rot. Regardless, this will drag things out for awhile and
will be messy af, especially since the members unfollowed him on their personal
insta accounts. You could argue the companies control those but idk man. Imagine
your company lying about you that you did something illegal and kicking you out
to get a huge penalty fee from you and your bandmates who you grew up with and
liked (at least a few of them) didnâ€™t believe you and you were simultaneously
removed. And this all happens after your entire group signed to a new label
together since you wanted to stay as one and continue being a group. And you
only had one comeback from the new label. Messyyyyy.</p>

      <p><p>hmmmm idk this is so sticky and I was looking at his updates I feel like this is more about what he considers unfair as company treatment I feel like he still did it tho ğŸ˜­ it was revealed through bunshun anyways so it wasn&apos;t his company or a Korean outlet</p></p>

      <p>i think bunshun only broke that he was hanging out with/hugging the japanese av
actress while it was korean media, specifically 10asia, that said he was
involved in prostitution and thatâ€™s who heâ€™s taking action against, right?
pretty sure the 10asia article also came out after he was already kicked from
the group so (at least to the public) they kicked h4knyeon out for the whole
â€˜hanging out with the japanese av actressâ€™ thing? so him getting kicked out and
him apparently not agreeing to it is a separate issue to kmedia saying he was
paying her for sex. idk itâ€™s kinda hard to keep track tho</p>

      <p><p>yea hes only taking them to legal and now that ive read more into it i can see his side of feeling like it was unfair the evidence was word of mouth from his members which still means he couldve slept with her but the company doing all that was insane. im not on his side i think its mad loserish to go out like that and the scandal still icks me out but the sneaks ending his career is so ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­</p></p>
