      <p>Woah after watching 3rd fancon it’s clear gyuvin, Ricky &amp; Yujin is so bad at
lipsyn like open your mouth guys &amp; guy &amp; yuj has so less self confident in
singing it’s so clear then their unc who is overconfident who make me laugh like
he ruin by screaming, I actually feel bad for jao he was trying so to hype &amp;
make it good performance then his two member with bad lipsyn, less confident &amp;
weird hand movement dance, I really gyuvin should get scolded by their strict
dance teacher so he understands we’re he lacking. Especially him, yuj, tae &amp;
uncl also sometime Rick, I really don’t understand he had good vocal &amp;
captivating performer but sometimes he give all &amp; sometime he doesn’t even try.
Also I think taerae is who can never be good in dance his style is so different
atleast he can sing. &amp; i think it clearly show who is talented member who has
potential &amp; who is accessories &amp; last, rick casually singing his part after unc
did his Owoo part was so embarrassing he can’t even sing that &amp; eat him, I
actually feel bad for his granny &amp; bro who came But I really really enjoy the
fancon just wish they had little fun game which involve fans like dance or guess
the song or something overall it was fun</p>
