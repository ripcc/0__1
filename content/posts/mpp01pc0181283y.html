      <p><p>I always knew they were gonna lose but their effort was admirable because either way they were getting shelved. I wish it was different but they&apos;re already at a huge disadvantage not being able to provide evidence because it&apos;s being withheld from them. I don&apos;t think they themselves even thought they&apos;d win they just wanted to be vocal </p></p>

      <p>i really really rooted for them and it was sad from the start actually not a
single day in tokkiville was peace, like wbk it was like that and we loveeee the
girls so much that&#x27;s why lot of tokkis were tolerating even supporting mhj cs
well that seem only thing to save them, and njz were fighting for the good, its
really admirable, wbk kpop contracts were basically selling urself no rights,
but everything that came out of that case, like ðŸ˜­ other fans should be with
them too, not bully them, its the same fans hating on the girls who&#x27;s favs be
having broken bones, fully schedules that&#x27;s making them faint or not protecting
them at all like kpop stans r so dumb, THEY CAN NEVER MAKE ME HATE U NJZ YOU

      <p>another anon: min heejin is so talented and I&#x27;m not saying that to worship her
as some otherworldly being but she really impressed me with those teasers and
mag shoot for their redebut in a matter of 3 months. I&#x27;m still obsessed with the
three letter animal character animations and the color gradient that everyone is
using on their pfps. I just think she is the best creative director in kpop and
I would also be heartbroken if she had a 7 year plan for them that is completely
wasted because hybe is hybe and thinks they can just replace her with some other
shitty director after a long hiatus.</p>
