1n2d team getting trashed on for their excessive editing and the qts saying the
pds also do too much … i love that they give the members comfort and a lot of
love but it does get cringey at times tbh u didnt give birth to this men . also
why do they include them eating for like 20mins like thats content pls😭</p>

      <p>omg i really like the 1n2d content, i find it fun, but if we had more options
maybe i wouldn&#x27;t like it as much since we&#x27;d actually have STUFF TO CHOOSE FROM
😐 but i noticed when i was watching one of the zbwon ones they replay parts of
dances so much that it&#x27;ll just keep playing one small bit of a song over and
over again and it gets annoying like damnnnnnnnnn it&#x27;s not that funny
