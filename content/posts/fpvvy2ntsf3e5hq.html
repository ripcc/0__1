      <p>curious about chanel&#x27;s opinion about jao attending gcci26 cruise because from
last year she said it&#x27;s possible unc and janbin were invited and couldn&#x27;t attend
due to schedule conflicts (or more like agreeing akgaes/solos words) but it&#x27;s
less likely for jao to be invited and look at what happened now lol.</p>

      <p>Leekn*w isn’t a BA and w1nter went to the 24 cruise and had a long term
relationship with them but was never a BA. Ryuj1n went too and she’s not a BA.
It’s not necessarily the case if they only invite potentially BAs.</p>

      <p>we’ve talked abt this before but gucci has a tendency to just string ppl along
for years w/out making them an official ba they started dressing leee kn0w in
like 2020 and never made him ba maybe the cn branch operates differently and jao
will get something official w them in the future but who knows</p>
