      <p>he still could be stressed about rapping tho? he was not satisfied with his rap
on bad boy but he had to be cause that was not the point of the video. for an
album, everybody would want it to be perfect. from what i remember hb took
advice from 5 for bad boy or cruel. him rapping in the new album doesnt seem
fae-fetched</p>
