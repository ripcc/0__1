      <p>I donâ€™t even think they will extend till feb for extra shows like people gotta
remember what kind of greedy bastard companies they come from. Plus I assume
evnâ€™s contract will run out at the same time so they can put the yhz and wk1z
together so they wonâ€™t extend any more than a couple weeks imo. The longest we
might get is mid to late Jan.</p>

      <p>When evn contracts longer than Jeb... Like wasn&#x27;t their original contract
suppose to be 1 year ish... The fact they will end the same time as jebs is
foul. Whereas jebs contract won&#x27;t be extended even by a little

ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I know all this evn business is to gather fanbase and exposure for them but
still unfair in a way :(</p>

extend a bit then they dword on yjn bday because wak1 want to at least complete
the whole bday cycle of all members then we gonna have them sad narrative to put
on dword videos how yjn was the last member to be announced also the last one to
complete the cycle when it ends</p>
