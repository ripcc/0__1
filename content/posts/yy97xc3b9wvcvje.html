      <p>im ngl before reading a few asks on ur ns/mond i didnt rlly pay attention to
jw’s attitude but like, he’s highkey a deadbeat #lol most of the time he’s
alone, and when’s he’s interacting w the members it’s fs and craziest thing is
that we’re so close to disbanding and he hasn’t made any progress in getting
closer to the other members when it’s clear theyre all at least kinda close to
each other. all his interactions feel soooo fake and honestly i’m staring to
dislike him more than anything… like you’d have a member talking normally and
here comes unc hogging the camera doing aegyo like boy if u don’t let ur
coworker speak 🤦🏻‍♀️ anyways mb sis for this rant im kinda mad tbh</p>
