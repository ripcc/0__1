      <p><p>it depends on how it&apos;s announced like let&apos;s say (this is not happening fjnfnfndn) that kfan was right and they do announce an extension at the fancon on their anniv. I think everyone would be overcome w joy and shed tears LIKE I WOULD DO A BACKFLIP 😭🙌🙌 but then worry would settle in because damn.. we gotta experience more bumness and who knows how much of wkns laze was due to the temporary factor what if they&apos;re just like <em>that</em>. Best case scenario is that they boss up (unrealistic ik 😅) and it depends on how long they extend because it&apos;s not worth keeping jwg scandal aside if he&apos;s ready for the military in 2 years 🤦‍♀️. But let&apos;s say it&apos;s announced at the end of the contract after anxiety stricken negotiation articles kill us and casuals/exfans come crawling back THIS WOULD BE TEAAAAA cuz they have a huge spotlight on them and we&apos;d expect contract changes. I would be fine if it was ot9 like I&apos;ll take that sacrifice im happy either scenario I rlly do love them in my own way </p></p>

      <p>as someone who has ulted w1 and iz1 i have to say the end of contract is the
funniest time. i had mutuals who dipped during debut era be active during the
last cb. dont get me wrong those are fake btches, but its also funny like oh you
didnt dieshsjsj</p>
