      <p>Hybe is trying to make an I&#x27;ll see you there tomorrow 2.0 bc that song was the
one who made some noise from that specific comeback (which it makes sense bc
dejavu was a mid boring song with a good MV) but this new song sounds outdated
like I&#x27;ll see you there tomorrow had the typical 2016 kpop tropical house
elements but at least it didn&#x27;t sound outdated... This new one sounds like a
2014 Zedd x Pop artist song.</p>
