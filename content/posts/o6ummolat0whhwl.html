      <p>Was chilling and then scrolled on Twitter and realized that my bias who I
thought was hot af and was a fan of for like over 2 years actually isnâ€™t that
handsome and that Iâ€™ve been enamored by his personality and itâ€™s symptomatic of
my own loneliness and insecurity around inexperience and I need therapy and not
to be infatuated with a random Korean man who I wouldnâ€™t even be able to
communicate with. Also realized, which I always knew but maybe not recognized
100% of the time, his persona is for sure not the same as he is in person. And
idols just do a little dancey dance and sing (sometimes) but on a societal lense
their industry is commonly actually really harmful to like everyone.



Random fan ego death on a Thursday night is a 10/10 not recommend. Luv the music
tho.</p>
