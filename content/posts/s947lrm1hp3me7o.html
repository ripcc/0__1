      <p>why are zroses acting like this means zbwon are going on idol radio when it&#x27;s
obviously about old episodes being broadcast in japan as 1. why would the news
come from a japanese publication rather than the actual idol radio source 2.
they specifically mention two jpop groups as this is news catered towards a
japanese audience rather than just them being guests in the future in general
(if that makes sense) 3. s*v*nteen and str*y k*ds would not go on idol radio at
this stage in their careers 4. why would ZBWON go on a radio show when they
hardly do promotions??? like i know we don&#x27;t have translators but what happened
to inferring from context clues
