      <p>honestly i have so much respect for zh, he has the most insane fans from every
single angle and he constantly refuses to let them mould him (+ that one rumor
about him supposedly cursing them out on wc) i love this for him fr

im sure it affects him a lot and it would be a lot easier for him to just
pretend to be someone he isn&#x27;t to appeal to them lol</p>

      <p>Similar topic but like anon said considering how busy he is I’m really suprised
at how quickly he’s improving on languages. I wanted to take the jlpt and was
studying for ages for it with private lessons too but once uni started i
literally had no time and my skills just went downhill so fast</p>
