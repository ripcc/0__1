      <p>apparently thereâ€™s a korean taiwanese trainee who is also one of the visual
trainees and who i thought would be the favorite korean ala janbin and heâ€™s
lowkey a yjn clone but if heâ€™s half taiwanese no way koreans would be fully
warmed up to him right i canâ€™t figure out whoâ€™s gonna be the mnet pick tho</p>

      <p>This guy? He&#x27;s Taiwanese. As to why he&#x27;s on planet K instead of C I&#x27;m assuming
because he&#x27;s Taiwanese and we all know the Taiwanese China drama.

      <p>imo i think it has nothing to do with race but where (china or korea) you want
to promote/ debut in. like you can be chinese and want to debut in the korean
group because you want to promote in korea so you apply/ join planet k</p>

      <p>I really dont know why Mn3t decided to divide them like this. Its kinda obvious
they dont want any c trainees in the group ðŸ˜‚ Why go through all that trouble..
I know they want another Wann1ne type of a group and they know they can only
achieve that with no chinese member in the group (Kuanl1n wasnt chinese) so why
even bother?? If it was cause of International fans, they were gonna tune in
anyways ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
