      <p>if mnet starts restricting live recording/screenshots of daechinso and youtube
broadcast of mcountdown, it will most likely affect live recordings on plus chat
too I guess</p>

      <p>i wasn&#x27;t online for when mcd was broadcasting tho i&#x27;m sure this was the case
then too but when i was watching daechinso i noticed they did it through
whatever the video player they use for mnet plus is instead of youtube which
they did before and i just find that so stupid like mnet plus is notoriously
trash and youtube is proven to work like literally everyone uses that for
livestreaming and watching videos so why ditch it? ðŸ˜­ i feel like it&#x27;s probably
bc if someone shares the mcd youtube live link with u u can just watch the show
through there rather than having to download mnet plus so they want more people
to use their app but UGH. plus not allowing screenshots/screen recordings is
extra stupid bc those being reposted on other platforms can make ppl interested
and tune in to the official broadcast like they&#x27;re trying to get the bag but
they&#x27;re also running from the bag</p>
