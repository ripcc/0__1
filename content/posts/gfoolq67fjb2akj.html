      <p>Not even hating and I know they&#x27;re pretty but sometimes they be doing too much
with the filters 😭 99% of the time in those fancalls they be using those
filters with setting to the max you know that slim jaw and make eyes bigger etc
and you can tell because the fancall shows their face when they&#x27;re talking but
when they suddenly move they edit an emoji over their faces because the filter
is glitching 😭</p>
