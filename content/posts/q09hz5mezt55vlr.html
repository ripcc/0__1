      <p>Maybe we need tr to slap some reality inside his head. He indeed got too much
unnecessary kindness. Plus he treat this job in a way he still can have fun.
Yea, good for you for exploring producing music etc and still got some time to
sleep (a lot actually) yea your mental health is important! But bro, you are not
even as busy as hb, yj or gv, you are not even in school or college, you
literally did nothing except for eating sleeping and practicing which other
busier members also did, can you at least give us something? Did he play too
much with unc to the point his idgafness rubbed off on him? Or too busy with lil
gf? Or is he on burnout period? Doesn&#x27;t he realize he can&#x27;t keep being an idol
with this mindset as this industry already oversaturated and meddled big time by
big companies/conglomerates? If he wanna be like this, just become a solo artist
in specific genre. It will hard to become as famous as an idol but if his goal
just wanna have fun performing on stage that would be a better choice than an
idol. If he can&#x27;t do it for himself, just do it for his real bro? Also everytime
ppl were looking for him he be like &#x27;i did sth at jellyf&#x27; which is annoying af
or &#x27;just back from schedule&#x27; when it was just preparation of cb that everyone
can predict.</p>
