      <p>Tbh tho sm and hy*e both had their foot in with mca, idk what sm did by pulling
sh out, tbh r11ze whole man agent seems a mess rn. Also sm and hy*e both have mc
at mucore too. I guess they might bid for an inki spot but they already got
hands on the mubank spots. Plus they canâ€™t exactly have much sway with mca when
thatâ€™s cj grounds.</p>
