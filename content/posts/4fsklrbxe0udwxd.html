      <p>Also people fail to consider that itâ€™s not about visas or permission like yes
chn people can still go, c fans still went but with how much the situation
worsened this week alone (and Iâ€™m talking chn putting nuk3s really close to tw)
ofc public figures are going to have to be weary about where they go and what
they do especially when anything could break out at any second. I also think
itâ€™s ignorant when fans say chn wouldnâ€™t go to war with tw because they consider
it part of chn, like thatâ€™s exactly why they would go to war ðŸ˜­ they want to be
1 but tw doesnâ€™t. Look at ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° and ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ both fight over Kashmir which they both
claim as their own but have no bother about using it as a battleground</p>

      <p>Diffrent anon but I also disagree with it being a visa issue like tbh this is
wk1 they would have just said if it was. Also the organisers themselves said
they got the necessary documents to perform there (the organisers are the ones
who have to get a performance visa for the artist) so I donâ€™t see why an entry
visa would have been an issue at all especially when zbone have been to tw
before and wk1 already knows about the rules and the chn members know too. I
think if it was a visa thing the organisers (who said they are investigating)
would have just said so themselves too since they are getting heat aswell but if
itâ€™s political itâ€™s not like they or wk1 is going to come out and publicly say
that.</p>
