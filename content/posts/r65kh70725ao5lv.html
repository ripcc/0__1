      <p>idk if you guys care... but..this is exposing previous admins of zh fanclub.
essentially the previous admins of zh fanclub continuously sent him horrible and
nasty hate letters under the guise of helping him &quot;to improve&quot; from criticism
(their own criticism, that is). they did this through fansigns or just sending
the letters through other means. they also wrote the letters from &quot;crosins&quot; as a
whole, and basically told him this is the feeling and frustrations of all his
fans. they told him he didn&#x27;t understand the fans feelings and took advantage,
they said his fans keep buying for him but he does nothing in return, they even
said a bunch of times that if he doesn&#x27;t do what crosins want then they&#x27;ll all
leave him. then they kept telling him that all his success and fame is because
of them, and it&#x27;s only thanks to them that hao is successful now and tried using
it as leverage. &quot;fans are becoming exhausted because of you, if you don&#x27;t comply
with our demands then fans will leave you&quot;



they also made up lies and gossips about the company, about the members, about
other fans even and told him all of that. op said the letters were full of
resentment and threats.



this is likely the reason there was a time zh was feeling really down, and kept
alluding to hoping fans wouldn&#x27;t leave him.



the letter they attached is the &quot;mildest&quot; one and the least hateful apparently,
but it&#x27;s still pretty bad. they told him to not say things like the group&#x27;s
sales are important to him (they want him to not mention the group at all and
act as a soloist &quot;for his own benefit&quot;). they scolding and warned him about his
fansign answers, and with the context (they blurred many things) a lot of it is
most likely about his answers to zerocolas. they said things like &quot;don&#x27;t answer
things that don&#x27;t reveal your true heart&quot; and says his fanbase is becoming
unstable because of it.



this all continued between late 2023 till late 2024 from what op is saying...
yeah

      <p>At one point in the letter they say yeah X will be at the fansign asking you
questions and given how massive his cbar is and how intertwined it is to his
career they must have been stressing him out literally every other day irl and
through hate mail with this bullshit what I find more confusing is that these
admins are STILL his fans like if you hate literally everything he does and is
to the point you send him several 4/5 pages hate letters every now and again
WHYYY stayðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­I just cannot understand the psychology behind people like this at
all

It really recontextualises a lot of what he did between late 2023 and late 2024</p>
