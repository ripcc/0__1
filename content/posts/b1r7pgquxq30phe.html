      <p>Have you ever get bored and suddenly thought which one comes first, the word
&quot;fly&quot; or animal &quot;flies&quot;? If the word &quot;fly&quot; comes first then why flies are the
one getting the name flies when there are a lot of animals that fly such as
birds, bees, butterflies? If its the latter, did they see flies and decide
something that floats can be called flying or they just randomly decide it was
&quot;fly&quot;? But why flies? Don&#x27;t get me started on fireflies because they looked more
like crickets but named as fireflies like why? Also why fire? Is it because it
has a nice ring or because fire was the sole source of man-made light back then?
Does that mean the terms fly comes before fire? Isn&#x27;t it weird?</p>
