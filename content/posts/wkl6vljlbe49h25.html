      <p>the zbtving staff really stretch out these episodes like they're so lazy ðŸ˜­ i
remember those gaming episodes from last year felt like they were going on
forever (pretty sure it was bc they added that random plus chat exclusive
episode where they gamed with zroses), the last dating/friendship series being 3
episodes and now them doing 3 units instead of just different, separate ot9
episodes with something new each time. i wish they'd give us real content</p>
