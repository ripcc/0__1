      <p>i wonder what post-disbandment is gonna be like with member perceptions bc i
know with w1 i think w4nnables hate j43hwan, especially with that drama with him
claiming j1nyoung was being bullied by c1x but idk if they felt/expressed this
during the group&#x27;s run, there&#x27;s probably similar with exwon, i don&#x27;t think the
produce ggs have really experienced that so i think it&#x27;s a bg fanbase thing ðŸ˜­
like who are zroses gonna still rock with, who will they drop (this is more like
w1zones since none of them gaf about the j members minus s4kura and then i don&#x27;t
think they really care about the non-le ss3rafim/1ve members now that i think
about it other than like y3na? i&#x27;d say tr is gonna fall into this but i wonder
if other members will) and are they gonna admit to secretly hating members bc i
had a vision of this happening with jw the day right after disbandment, like
everyone just airing their grievances out LMAO</p>

      <p><p>their words not mine but he didn&apos;t wanna be in the group at all playm forced him to go on pdx (he&apos;s a vikton member) and he made it but he wanted to be in his group still. they said he&apos;s the reason they disbanded he was salivating for it and ruined the group ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he was the oldest being 94 and most of the group was 99 and under mind you it&apos;s 2019 so they were young. he still wasn&apos;t as deadbeaty as unc he grew to form relationships w them but yea that&apos;s ab it </p></p>

      <p>to add, when the voting manipulation scandal broke, xone was put into hiatus but
sgwoo was seen hanging out with bigton often during those times. iirc there were
some witness pic of him went to have a drink with them. thats why lots of wonits
hate him, especially considering how he was the leader of xone but couldnt seem
to protect the group and went to have a fun with his OG group instead when
everyone (xone + wonits) was literally having a hard time</p>
