      <p><p>Basically kai started this recruitment streamer workshop he made ppl apply and it&apos;s basically what the name says they rented out a university for the week and had classes and shit. the point of this was to help small creators learn but obviously there was more big to mid tier streamers they&apos;ll bring the views, they had big streamers as professors too some of them took it serious some didn&apos;t the whole thing was troll but some ppl did in fact grow</p></p>

      <p>yeah and it was a good way for small streamers to learn the business aspect of
streaming and get their name out there because everyone there was streaming at
the same time on their own twitch so sometimes the bigger streamers would
randomly pop up introducing their audience to the smaller streamers and the
bigger streamers were mostly there to troll for content which was fun ðŸ˜­ it just
gave troll college dorm days like i just came home from college for summer and
those streams already made me miss it</p>
