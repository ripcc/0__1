This was the moment I knew it was time to unstan. Likeâ€¦ what kind of marketing
is that? ðŸ˜­ you finally have a survival show group closest to the hype the
produce groups ha, they just debuted, and instead of focusing on promoting the
full group and pushing the song everywhere to go for that potential high chart
(especially when Korean GP had an hyper focus on the idol market because of IVE
and New Jeans comeback), youâ€™re making shipping the main promotional strategy?
That should be something the fanbase naturally does, not the company. I still
find it laughable they turned the debut into a fanfiction starter pack.</p>

      <p>eh idk anon itâ€™s not like they only pulled out tingle for jaobin its a popular
content like rice were just on it a couple weeks ago. it would make more sense
if you were upset with the yits teaser and all the duo tiktoks since it seemed
like they were going in that direction but then the company pulled back on that
strategy. debut wasnâ€™t bad actually in hindsight they got radio shows, variety
content, yt content, etc like it all went to shit after music shows finished and
august/september happened but my hopes for the group werenâ€™t crushed until
melting point era</p>

      <p><p>it&apos;s not surprising they went on it I get the hype was there but it feels crazy that we got 2 debut tingle videos and never a show about them becoming a group like... ðŸ˜­....... priorities all over the place I had an issue with those too like it was all just a culmination of non group things way too early. debut wasn&apos;t bad yea it was the best time we ever had and I was happy but it wasn&apos;t normal and set us up for failure </p></p>
