      <p>I think itâ€™s because he got quite sick and lost his voice when they made him do
it for Japan, Iâ€™ve seen some of his I fans seem a bit unhappy about all 3 days
too probably</p>

      <p>well they&#x27;re always sooooo overproud about him MCing and even calls the other
members leech whenever they also get the special mc (just like that mca anniv)
so now it&#x27;s the only thing they can get. their mass tweak once he steps down as
the mc will be crazy</p>
