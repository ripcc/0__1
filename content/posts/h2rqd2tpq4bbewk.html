      <p>oh wow anons were right about hair changes. i was expecting hb with brown hair
but there&#x27;s also gw with wine red, tr platinum blond and jw silver/green (?). i
think the rest are the same. hb looks good, gw looks good from what i&#x27;ve seen,
there&#x27;s not much to judge with tr bc he&#x27;s got a beanie on but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s
awful bc they could&#x27;ve bleached his brows but thank god they left them dark,
points could be lowered when i see the full thing, and then jw...... i don&#x27;t
like it lmao</p>
