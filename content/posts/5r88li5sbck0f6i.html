      <p>i just saw a full group pic of w1sh for the first time and why are kfans gagging
over them, there's maybe one and a half decently looking members, the state of
male idol's visuals is so bad for this gen that these girls are just stanning
anything and zebewon is about to disband so it's gonna get even worse :( are
companies running out of male trainees or why is there no more jungk00ks,
eunw00s, Ls, etc like i feel male visuals were wayy more distintic or at least
had different bone structures before now most of them look like nugu bl actors</p>

      <p>i feel like this upcoming bp will showcase just how rare zeebeewan are when it
comes to visuals (im talking about ktrainees cause ctrainees always serve). like
right now the rumored nugu idol bp contestants who probs will get most intl fan
votes are sooo chopped and so are their respective groupsðŸ’€</p>
