      <p>even if gyv got sick or needed to stay fsr why would hbn have to stay üò≠

      <p>i mean the leader didnt even stay when rik was left at the airport for their
reality show filming at jeju back then so him staying probably had something to
do with a schedule rather than gyub himself</p>

      <p>speaking of campzbwon it feels like the members have free days so often that
wake1 could definitely make a season 2 and send them off doing activities
somewhere for a few days like it's definitely in their wheelhouse üôÉ everyone's
been begging since the first one (tb to blue mv filming when zroses thought they
were filming campzbwon in thailand) and it's good, casual group content. they
probably tried replicating that with the busan content (completely forgot that
even existed before typing this ask ngl) but that was so corporate since it was
some sponsored tourist shit and boring. it was so good when we were trying to
watch some shitty tv emnet stream of the first episode without subs</p>

      <p>some members have free days only on days where other members have individual
schedules. they never have been off work at the same time as a group except for
that one time where zh went for a trip to thailand rk went back home to la/cn
and osakaz to japan. that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve been criticizing wk1 for accepting too
many individual opportunities when they should be doing more group stuffs and
probably then we would get campzbwon 2</p>
