      <p>Don&#x27;t shell out money to any random person and end up getting scammed guys ðŸ˜­.
Keep in mind there&#x27;s a really big counterfeit market and no way to tell if the
quality is legit if you&#x27;re ordering online. Some fakes can indeed be good if
they&#x27;re backed up with good reviews and hype but a lot of them are low-quality
and look really dumb (&quot;cucci&quot;, &quot;pradu&quot;, random nonsensical english on t-shirts,
etc.). Why do you think chinese people are obsessed with real brand names? Sure,
you can try it, but people really underestimate how many questionable fakes
there are and how cunning some of these random online sellers can be just to
make a quick buck off you.</p>
