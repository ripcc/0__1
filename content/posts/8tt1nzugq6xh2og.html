      <p>Shippers who think they are an oppressed fan minority and are super insecure
about wanting proof their ship is real are quite literally the most dangerous
fans to have and we&#x27;re entering that territory with haobinists</p>

      <p>Shippers who unstan or turn on the members they ship when they no longer feel
satisfied by the content are just equally vile.. maybe we don&#x27;t see much of it
on intl side but cn and kr ones are just as unhinged as akgaes like zrcls were
straight up wishing death on zgh when he went to that exhibition looool and
saying some real fucked up shit and how they will turn into antis.. maybe some
of y&#x27;all just dont have experience with toxic shippers but yeah in general
akgaes are worse obviously as they won&#x27;t hesitate to do anything to damage the
career or reputation of their bias&#x27;s rival members</p>
