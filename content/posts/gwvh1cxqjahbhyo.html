      <p>this is funny bc i can see that happening due to their popularity but i remember
those guys in t3mpest who were on broduce took 5 whole years after the show to
debut in that group like sure they had a subunit in between (which i doubt many
ppl were tuning in for) but LMAOOOOOOOOOO.. maybe yh learned their lesson!</p>
