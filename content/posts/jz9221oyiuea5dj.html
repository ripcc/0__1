      <p>i think matty&#x27;s probably the only one who could possibly find this if he really
tried also it&#x27;ll be funny af if he saw one of ur cancel threads LMFAOOOOO and
kept tabs for the juicy gossip ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ tbh i think the members are all nosey
about themselves and what their fans are gossiping about like im pretty sure
most of them know about their own dcgalls</p>

      <p>I think he lurk less now and that&#x27;s better for him the only good things coming
out from him lurking was when he shared fanarts of him and showed how he
appreciated them yknow that kind of acknowledgement every idols fanartists want</p>
