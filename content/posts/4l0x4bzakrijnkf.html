      <p>I find it funny that a3spa/k@rina intl fans are saying kr feminists are standing
with her like a lot of them aren&#x27;t actual homophobes/transphobes and racists ðŸ˜­
the concept of intersectionality is just nonexistent to a lot of people there
and they&#x27;re acting like gender discrimination is the only thing that&#x27;s wrong
about conservatives, ntm she&#x27;s becoming the goddess of kr incels since her
&quot;apology&quot; didn&#x27;t explicitly state she opposes the PPP, and if anything actual
feminists should be urging her to clear up her stance because it&#x27;s just shameful
she doesn&#x27;t care her name/image is being used to promote such bigotry</p>
