      <p>I think that jeemin is not a bad mc but there are people much better than her. I
can see that she&#x27;s the shy pretty smiley type. I feel like in order to be a good
mc you need to have a little bit of personality. But it doesn&#x27;t really matter
cause this is music show even yujin got to be one</p>
