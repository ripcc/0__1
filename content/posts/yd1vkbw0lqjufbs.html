      <p>I‚Äôm going to hate watch üò≠ i‚Äôm fiercely loyal to jb1, they are the only svs
group i‚Äôve ever stanned despite me watching the entire produce/planet series in
previous years and i‚Äôve pretty much given up on stanning any group post jb1 as
well because i‚Äôm too old for this shit now. it‚Äôs going to be fun comparing the
shows and final lineups but i don‚Äôt think they can top it lol and a lot of the
media play of this show is using jb1‚Äôs name. The nugu failed idols attending
mostly likely aren‚Äôt going to make it like hui and keita most people want fresh
faces in svs groups now</p>

      <p>they won&#x27;t succeed tbh being gay and their genuine friendship and chemistry
aside the no1 reason jaobin rivalry/friendship centerz thing attracted a lot of
ppl and made them both stay at the top for almost the whole show was cause they
were both very talented + good looking + passionate it&#x27;s hard to find idols with
all 3 nowadays</p>
