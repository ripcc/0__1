like interviewed and they show the day to day lives of the group????? those
l*ckyz accounts are gonna have a field day seeing the managers if thatâ€™s the
case LMAOOOOOOOOOO but also wait now that i think about it and search for it
more, doesnâ€™t this show show the idolsâ€™ dorms? theyâ€™re gonna have to have jw act
