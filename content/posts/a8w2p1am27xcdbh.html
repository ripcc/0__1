      <p>also he does not have any smear campaign like hanbin and he has the cp fans of
gyujin and gyubrick, i would not be surprised if some crosin like his cp with
hao. most importantly, he is part of yuehuaz</p>

      <p>sometimes id see his hate trains on weibo fanwars and ofc they bust out his ex
gf couple pics but it backfires because random cnets who stumble opon the fanwar
always end up saying hes so sweet for wanting to commit with a ring at such a
young age ðŸ˜­</p>
