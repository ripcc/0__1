      <p>so many factors that made this happen but the fact that rik doesnt really gaf
about giving online fanservices to his fans prolly is the biggest reason of
this. i get he has this cool image he&#x27;s trying to pursue but someone&#x27;s gotta
whack him to remember that he is still an idol after allðŸ’” as much as he might
hate it, parasocialism is literally the base of idol-fan relationship. i feel
like nothing can change him unless the company/the members themselves are
&#x27;scolding&#x27; him for this. dont get me wrong, i love him that&#x27;s why i want him to
be better. i&#x27;m not saying he has to be online 24/7 for his fans but not coming
to a paid fan-communication service for days just doesn&#x27;t seem something that
can be viewed positively or defended unless he&#x27;s sick SICK but we all know he&#x27;s
24/7 on his tab to watch those kdramas</p>
