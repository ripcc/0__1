anon not the one that said you would know everything on the cside. but yeah lmao
it&#x27;s still pretty common knowledge from what i&#x27;ve seen that his contract ends
soon and he was never gonna be in the yhz group anyways that was planned before
he even joined the company where have y&#x27;all been brother</p>

      <p>anon i&#x27;m also in crosin gcs? no one has ever said that his contract ends this
year there is discourse and fighting every day about his future including
whether fans want him to be in the group or not and this is because no one knows
what he&#x27;s going to do and when his contract ends. if it&#x27;s common knowledge i&#x27;d
like to see a post on his supertopic or even xhs where people discuss it i&#x27;m
happy to be proven wrong. also which admin? ex or current because that matters</p>
