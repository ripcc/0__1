      <p>tartar fans love to flex about how tartar made to the lineup without a
screentime but if you watched bopeul, you&#x27;d notice that he&#x27;s always been pushed
as a main vocal since the audition. for back door, the main vocal was actually
ynseo (yes that evven guy) but he was the one who got highlighted as the group&#x27;s
vocalist and for that man in luv stage, he literally got the whole group&#x27;s
screentime for himself LOL if he wasnt highlighted as a main vocal during the
show, he wouldnt even make it pass the first two rounds sorry he&#x27;s short and got
a big head. visual-wise he&#x27;s a hard pass</p>

      <p>And ppl always forget that he was one of the 3 people whose ranks were revealed
before the final, like we all know ppl love to bring up them revealing hbn rank
3 but no one mentions how them revealing tartar’s rank essentially pushed him
into the lineup. They wanted phanb1n too but it didn’t work for them.</p>

      <p>If mn3t reveals you to be in the top9 its cause they want you out (fans thinking
youre safe and trying to save someone else) or they think you can manage well on
your own (rank stays consistent/doesnt fall out) BUT if mn3t shows you out of
the top9 its cause they want you in and I could argue bout this with anybody</p>
