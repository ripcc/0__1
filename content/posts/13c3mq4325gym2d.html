      <p>my prediction for b2p as a show and the group



the show will do well in korea as is the norm koreans will gag over anything
mnet. but idk just how well cause the bg market has changed a lot since 2022.
there was practically no bg famous enough in kr by end of 2022 but now we have
so many but ig we&#x27;ll have to see. internationally again there&#x27;s no way of saying
ppl will obviously will be tuned in cause of the 1st seasons fame but if they
want the same levels again crazy crazy things need to happen like it can&#x27;t just
be one funny audition when bp was going on I couldn&#x27;t escape it on twt ig or
tiktok there needs to be rcky levels of gaggy visuals or the gayness again
(that&#x27;s not gonna happen duh) it&#x27;s unpredictable but I just don&#x27;t see it
reaching the BIG level of international engagement again idk



for the final group again they&#x27;ll do well in korea but depends on how well riice
pnd wish etc are still doing by then and how well bighitnbg ygnbg or smtr do.
internationally ehh again I just don&#x27;t seem them doing better than like p1h
levels tbh having international support from the show is kind of a double edged
sword cause if the show gets a lot of international support they&#x27;ll for sure be
voting in untalented chops just cause they&#x27;re chinese or being woke with minors
which will make them lose the kr support slightly



anyways coke rant cause I don&#x27;t wanna say all this on twt</p>

      <p><p>bp was television history and it&apos;s so obvious mnts going straight for the replica kill so idk if any of the moments will get viral just cuz I have a feeling it&apos;ll be scripted downnnnn </p><p></p><p>but yea for sure popular in korea it&apos;ll be popular in general more popular than the og? I don&apos;t think so just cuz like you said the bg market was dead that the revival/newgen aspect made it so attractive and that isn&apos;t the case anymore </p><p></p><p>the market rivalry is way worse big 4 is genuinely deep in it so idk fjjdjfkkdkdkc the lineup also has to be good omg they just need to take away global voting period THEY ALWAYS VOTW IN THE WORST PEOPLE WITH THEIR STUPID WOKE</p></p>

      <p>nah those token fans are evil and scheming they might be the ones trying to
replicate and steal 2B1&#x27;s fame even more than mnet I already saw them open a
yao1 group chat for shipp1ng any trainiies and it reached more than a hunny
members</p>
