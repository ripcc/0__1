      <p>does anybody else think the ultimate winner of this whole nwjs vs hyb3 feud is
gonna be mhj? she's probably abandoning the nwjs girls cuz it's gonna be years
for the legal battle to settle and they can't work for her and debuting a new
boygroup that can help pay all her legal fees and you know people are gonna tune
in cause bgs are in the lowest they've ever been, hybe as a company even if
they're doing well monetarily will never get a top gg or bg ever again, beeteess
was their one and only lucky strike and even then now they're all old, washed
and way past their prime cuz no one is gonna stream their cb except for armies,
their other bgs are boring, hideous, most of them can't sing and the music is
forgettable and their ggs reputation got damage by all the scandals they had
last year, neither ill1t of lsf will ever be the nation's girl group, and nwjs
won't be either cuz their image is tainted as well but at least they had the
title for 2 years, i know fatty bangpd biggest regret in life is taking mhj
under his company</p>
