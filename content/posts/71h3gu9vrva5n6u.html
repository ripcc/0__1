      <p>People within the fandom will have different opinions but as someone who isnâ€™t
on stan twt anymore and far removed from these sfs dick measuring contests his
sales actually arenâ€™t bad. Because remember to the c market what it will look
like is a 5th gen kr idol with a very small Chinese fanbase able to sell more
and similar numbers to his group mates who have bigger fanbases and more
connection there. Is it gag worthy out of this world amazing, no, but itâ€™s not
bad at all for him and his size fanbase.</p>
