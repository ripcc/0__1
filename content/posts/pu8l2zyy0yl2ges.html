      <p><p>I&apos;m exaggerating 😭 they just said the choreo hbn created for sweat had sinister intentions because there&apos;s a part where hbn used zghs back to support the move. he had back pain at the time but it was literally just schizophrenia pon schizophrenia</p></p>

      <p>Nah the funniest part was from the front angle it did look like hb leaned on him
and in the perf 37 zh tripped up during that part and so fans assumed it’s
because he couldn’t hold hb so they were asking wk1 to change the choreo cuz of
hao’s bad back. Hb mentioned choreographing that bit so the cbar put out a
statement saying ‘the choreographers sinister intentions’ but it was pretty
obvious they were directing that to hb, the real funny part tho was when the
stage / side cams came out and turns out hb never leans on zh at all like their
backs don’t even make contact for 1 second he just tripped on his own 😭😭 and
the choreo that hb created was the tutting bit that allowed him to use his arms
to hold up his own weight instead of leaning on zh. So then they just looked
like assholes because the akgaes were calling him fat and a pig and all this
shit too when he didn’t even lean on zh in the first place 😭</p>
