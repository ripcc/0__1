      <p>It looks like Hb went with Fendi and Gucci dropped Jw because of that ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ This
doesnt look good for Jw because everybody felt like he was pushed along for the
Gucci thing but now it really looks like that was the case. Jw appeared with no
Gucci sponsorship TWICE to the airport and both times Hb was wearing Fendi. I
know that Zh has something going on with Gucci China. I wonder why they wont
dress him for Airport appearances tho. Im saying Gucci China because if he was
with Gucci Korea he would have gotten dressed everytime the other two do too or
attended the events in Korea. I also wonder why luxury brands dont want him more
in Korea. He is always getting the Chinese version of the brands. We get tvat he
is Chinese but he is still a Kpop Idol?? Dior seems to have dropped Yj and thats
why he is stuck with Barrie and thats about it I guess when it comes to
sponsorships within the group. I know that Gv got some Prada bag as a gift and
stuff, I wonder why they wont dress him even tho they send him Pr.</p>

      <p>Now that Anon has brought it up. I also think that Zh will go to China after Zb1
disbands. All of his important gigs are from China and everybody is expecting
YangWibo to leave his company. Zh will take his place. I think that Duhua
planned this the moment Zh stepped a foot into China or the moment she was those
sales from his Cbar. That women literally made WY, she can easily make another
one</p>

      <p>wang yibo is an extremely famous artist in cn, a real A lister. he was a member
of the kpop group uniq until yh sent him back to china and put the group in an
indefitine hiatus. anyway, he became a singer-actor and rose to fame after he
starred in the drama The Untamed with xiao zhan. Funnily enough he also has
insane solo/akgae fans and crazy shipper fans who believe he's dating xiao zhan
despite the fact they haven't interacted publicly in years. But yeah, I don't
agree with the first anon tho. Dh didn't make wang yibo. She tried to replicate
yibo's success with other artists but failed. The difference with zha0 is that
he had devoted cfans from the beginning which is rare in c-ent with very few
exceptions and it seems dh is interested in him with the way she brags about his
achievements and sales but who knows.</p>

      <p>YangWibo was getting dragged left and right for his acting on "The untamed"
especially since his partner was a very good actor. She put alot of money into
getting him good Weibo posts and getting him various other Gigs that might push
him in a good light. Do you really think that a nugu Idol, who came from Korea,
could achieve the things he did by himself? His company plays a huge role in
that. Some as you said are lost causes but thats mostly the Idols fault. I
really dont like it when fans dismiss the things companies do for their Idols.
We might not see them but they always do things for the Idols behind the scenes.
The ones that flop with all the pushing should never become Idols in the first
place.</p>
