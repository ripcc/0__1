      <p><p>Piggypuppy yes that&apos;s himmmm and ðŸ˜­.. that&apos;s his childhood nickname lmao but other than that he has a cute piggy nose so fans love using it as a rep animal. personally I don&apos;t like the association since I hate pigs but Koreans love animal typing so it&apos;s not a negative thing unless ppl purposely try to make it that way (trolls) </p></p>
