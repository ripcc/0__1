try and act like it’s ok on x they all know damn well had it been zh that was
cut there would have been trucks infront of that company by morning. I get the
show is focused on the manager but like why tf did they not agree to do this
while they were promoting so that we could actually see the managers managing
and their lives during that time.</p>
