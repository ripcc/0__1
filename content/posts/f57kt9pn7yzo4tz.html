      <p>love him mcing but I don't want that either tbh, if this show is going to be
airing till the end of the year and he's one of the ones were sure that won't
resign it just feels mean and tasteless to have him mc for a show that's
essentially going to be making their 'replacement' group</p>

      <p>It's precisely because of the won't renew contract that they'll put him there,
in a "see if u renew you'll get all these, if you don't well we have plenty of
people who do...." That way his company or himself will go "hmm maybe we need to
think this...."</p>
