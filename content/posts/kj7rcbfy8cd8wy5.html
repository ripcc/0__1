      <p>honestly i can‚Äôt see zhg and gyv bond over anything other than their shared
h4nbin obsession sdfghjjk and i wonder what it is about him that makes some ppl
obsess over him like gyv be acting like he found the long lost brother he‚Äôs
never had and if u know the wechat lore zhg went crazy for him like he‚Äôs never
done before for a bf</p>
