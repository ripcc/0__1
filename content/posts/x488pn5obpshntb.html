      <p>? that&#x27;s still not his original idea tho... he just adjusted the color because
it was voting time in korea ðŸ˜­ its like taking someones art, edit the hue a bit
and say it&#x27;s yours and put your watermark all over it lmao</p>

      <p>there was no og trend, he combined the flower clip and his clip afterwards so
yeah it is his idea. the og flower clip was just a clip originally not a part of
any trends.</p>
