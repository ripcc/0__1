      <p>heâ€™s still around I follow his ig and itâ€™s pretty active, heâ€™s one of the main
staff members besides the one w hair &amp; the bald one we saw on that manager show.
itâ€™s weird we donâ€™t see him as often but he definitely didnâ€™t quit considering
he was at the blue mv filming site</p>
