      <p>Lack of ot9 content and bug sfs divide and contract ending soon is really taking
a toll. Idk if anyone stanned any other svs group but was it like this towards
the end because I can already see the future where people just get more hostile
and nasty the closer this group get to disbanding ðŸ˜­</p>
