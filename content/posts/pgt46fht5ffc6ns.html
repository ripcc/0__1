      <p>I actually like this question because it makes me think like on the rare chance
that 1/2 leave and the rest stay ( I can even see a situation where yh pull out
zh but leave the other 3) what do you think would genuinely happen. Like in that
scenario of loosing hbn heâ€™s the leader and one of the most popular members so
itâ€™s not like weâ€™d be loosing a filler (no shade)</p>

      <p><p>now that u mention it I could see yh just deciding to speed up zghs chn career if the other 3 are secure in zbwon but that&apos;s where the problem starts. we rlly aren&apos;t ever getting a kepla story because losing a center or a leaders diff than losing some booboo mshiro </p></p>

      <p>Ignoring my hatred for a11ins I can see jebiz-2 doing well if hb stays and if jw
leaves. That way gp will give us a chance and we'll still have our leader and
I'll admit he does a good job. I really think yh will do anything to get zh back
tho since his path is pretty similar to wangyib0 both talented all rounder and
insane fandom buying power.</p>

      <p>tbh from all the info and tea ive seen if you ask me whose most likely not t
resign im putting hb at 1 and its nothing to do with what he wants like I 100%
think if it was down to him he would stay but his company already not a nbg in
the works for him and they are making it obvious they are waiting for him back.
the only reason im not putting zh at 1 is because yh and wk1 obviously can work
together someone that's how they got their second group evn, plus duhua
mentioning zb1 and even non yh members makes me think they recognize the value
of the group. in his situation I can even see yh bargaining for way more control
over his contract in exchange for him staying in the group. ik some anons talk
about him leaving yh but that depends on what artist contract he signed with
them because idt anyone has been able to leave until their contract has run out
so they must have really tight artist contracts.</p>

      <p><p>yup I agree hbns leaving his company has plans and yh works very closely so they could bargain. let&apos;s say by some miracle 7/9 stay like kepla I just don&apos;t think it would go through the balance of the group would be so wrecked and maybe the companies don&apos;t care ab that but I do. and I already know who they&apos;re making leader IM OFF THAT NO THANKS ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹</p></p>
