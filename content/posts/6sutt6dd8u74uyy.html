      <p>so dk if you care abt wswf but some koreans are saying they like 2 as mc but
intl side says he&#x27;s lacking as mc because he doesn&#x27;t hype up the battles and
don&#x27;t tell the dancers to like back off when they get too close or break a rule
(?) i think which k$ng dan1el used to do and maybe its because the dancers are
like his seniors and he&#x27;s a bit shy or hesitant but yeah they&#x27;re basically
saying this is why you shouldn&#x27;t use junior mc&#x27;s lmaoo and that they miss dan1el
but like yk he&#x27;s also in the military sooo i&#x27;m sure if it wasn&#x27;t for that yeah
they prob would have kept him</p>

all know his fans were the original schizo subfandom also sorry it&#x27;s unclassy
for a man to get in between two women fighting</p>
