      <p>i don't really have any desire to listen to their songs, at first i was
boycotting because people were leaving our boys just so that they can stan big4
groups later it just become disinterest. that's why i still haven't listen to
any pnd or siize song fully, only the tiktok portion but are their songs really
that good to chart like this
