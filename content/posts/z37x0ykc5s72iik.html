      <p>Gw just need a trigger to be competitive again like he was during BoysPlanet. He
was being comfortable for too long and doing charity too much it dies down his
charm. It is a good thing other members got much gigs he might snap out of it.
Worse case he might changed his life path after disbandment. His noonas need to
stop babying him and start to know when to give stick or carrot. Them rarely
stand up to protect him enough also play a role in shaping his mind, how he
never feel safe to release content out of plscht so it rarely reach wider
audience!</p>

      <p><p>UH NO. this is pure stupidity because this is just misdirected anger its not even a good complaint i would understand if they talked ab him dodging dance lives not posting or his stylistic choices even the goddamn nose filler but what control does he have over schedules? and trust me HIS NOONAS ARE SCHIZO AND EVIL THEY LIT HATE ON HIM EVERYDAY ON BURNERS HGJKGJHGJRKGJ HE LISTENS TO THE ABUSE SOMETIMES!! if his noonas were angels then pockygate wouldnt have happened this person sounds like theyve been in a 2 yr long coma where they didnt witness any of his shelving since he became a part of the group like baby this type of hope was killed in 2023 as soon as we saw him be a scheduleless member in every way #ACCEPTREALITY</p></p>

      <p>his noonas are your typical noonas who love to discipline their lil bro for
being unfit for their liking. they are quite schizo too, have you ever try to
explore gnw noonas egg account? you might think they are escaping from asylum,
they be hating and scolding him then babying him in a span of minutes. they spew
the entitled older sis type of nagging then goes that's my baby, sorry for
scolding you, i love you please don't do anything noona dislike</p>
