      <p>ngl would be funny as fuck if tomorrow yj and jao have solos and other ppl get a
duo/trio.. they&#x27;ve all said the setlist is different every day and i think gv
implied his solo today was today only (he also said smth about deja vu but i
cant tell if hes performing deja vu or if we&#x27;re about to get rk gv kick it which
would be even funnier)</p>

      <p>It wouldn&#x27;t matter because jao is the only member that SHOULD have had a solo
stage all 3 days (first of all, always should have obviously been on the
setlist) and the push is really fucking annoying and not working on me one bit</p>
