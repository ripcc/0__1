      <p>honestly. if wk1 put half as much effort into organizing schedules - like having
this show be done during a time where the boys were actually promoting so it
showed something relevant and interesting and new to the fans/gp - letting the
boys actually be free to post on all platforms/show their natural interactions
through their content, f just treat them with any ounce of respect as
people....as them bragging about how &quot;great&quot; they are through random ass press
releases that nobody fucking wants to see, pushing out corny, cringey ass
mediocre early 90&#x27;s, 2000&#x27;s marketing strategies and creating boring, terribly
scripted scenes that try to cover up the fact that one of the most detrimental
problems to the group has been living on his own cause he&#x27;s had his own f apt
since years and years ago.......



like always f wk1</p>
