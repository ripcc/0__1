1n2d team getting trashed on for their excessive editing and the qts saying the
pds also do too much ‚Ä¶ i love that they give the members comfort and a lot of
love but it does get cringey at times tbh u didnt give birth to this men . also
why do they include them eating for like 20mins like thats content plsüò≠</p>

      <p>omg i really like the 1n2d content, i find it fun, but if we had more options
maybe i wouldn't like it as much since we'd actually have STUFF TO CHOOSE FROM
üòê but i noticed when i was watching one of the zbwon ones they replay parts of
dances so much that it'll just keep playing one small bit of a song over and
over again and it gets annoying like damnnnnnnnnn it's not that funny

      <p>it might be bc they're contracted for one hour episodes and sometimes there's
just not enough content to cover it? or they're trying to give every member
screentime</p>
