      <p>I’m going to hate watch 😭 i’m fiercely loyal to jb1, they are the only svs
group i’ve ever stanned despite me watching the entire produce/planet series in
previous years and i’ve pretty much given up on stanning any group post jb1 as
well because i’m too old for this shit now. it’s going to be fun comparing the
shows and final lineups but i don’t think they can top it lol and a lot of the
media play of this show is using jb1’s name. The nugu failed idols attending
mostly likely aren’t going to make it like hui and keita most people want fresh
faces in svs groups now</p>
