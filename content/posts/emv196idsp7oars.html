      <p>Also people fail to consider that itâ€™s not about visas or permission like yes
chn people can still go, c fans still went but with how much the situation
worsened this week alone (and Iâ€™m talking chn putting nuk3s really close to tw)
ofc public figures are going to have to be weary about where they go and what
they do especially when anything could break out at any second. I also think
itâ€™s ignorant when fans say chn wouldnâ€™t go to war with tw because they consider
it part of chn, like thatâ€™s exactly why they would go to war ðŸ˜­ they want to be
1 but tw doesnâ€™t. Look at ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° and ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ both fight over Kashmir which they both
claim as their own but have no bother about using it as a battleground</p>

      <p>Stop being misled by the US government. The US government has no business
talking about &quot;China&#x27;s going to invade Taiwan&quot; because there is no such intent.
The US themselves are the aggressor in the situation. China and Taiwan will not
go to war not just because it is completely against the rhetoric China has been
endorsing, but also because there are so many cross-strait familial and business
ties.</p>
