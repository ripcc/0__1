      <p><p>&quot;to rest&quot; so what they do everyday üòÇ right.. it&apos;s a schedule most likely that&apos;s the only they stay behind for if gyv was feeling unwell they&apos;d prob just take him home it takes an hr to get back</p></p>

      <p>even if gyv got sick or needed to stay fsr why would hbn have to stay üò≠
realistically theyd just have one of their managers stay w him its not like
hbn‚Äôs presence will nurse him back to health</p>

      <p>i mean the leader didnt even stay when rik was left at the airport for their
reality show filming at jeju back then so him staying probably had something to
do with a schedule rather than gyub himself</p>

      <p>speaking of campzbwon it feels like the members have free days so often that
wake1 could definitely make a season 2 and send them off doing activities
somewhere for a few days like it's definitely in their wheelhouse üôÉ everyone's
been begging since the first one (tb to blue mv filming when zroses thought they
were filming campzbwon in thailand) and it's good, casual group content. they
probably tried replicating that with the busan content (completely forgot that
even existed before typing this ask ngl) but that was so corporate since it was
some sponsored tourist shit and boring. it was so good when we were trying to
watch some shitty tv emnet stream of the first episode without subs</p>
