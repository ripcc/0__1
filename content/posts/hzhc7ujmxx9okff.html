      <p>Icl this is why we never get group or unit shit cuz people still complain. Like
if it was the group anniversary I think I’d get people being mad but idt ive
ever had an ult to a live for their fandom’s birthday before and it seemed like
this was pretty spontaneous since they didn’t even have enough chairs.
