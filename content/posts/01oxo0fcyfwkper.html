      <p><p>Basically it&apos;s civilians yelling at them because the mob is blocking ppl from catching their flights. it&apos;s kinda similar to the byun wseok airport thing he got hate for and everyone basically agrees with the civilians, cuz yea making schedules out of airport sightings and risking other ppls flights isn&apos;t good. They&apos;re cussing the idols out nastyyyy tho icl ðŸ˜­ idk what the guy is saying for shion but the h1h things on pchoa </p></p>
