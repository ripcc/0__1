      <p>THE WORST EVER. Can you believe VIXX was creating a whole new trend with their
traditional concept album from inclusion, stage direction, choreography, songs
and outfits to the point they were invited by the president only for jelpi to
let the hype died out just like that? Gugudan also got their momentum with their
first comeback after suckass debut only for them to release the ugliest song
ever not long after, followed by the unfairest line distribution song and ended
up crashing their moment for both gp and dedicated fans. But on lemino ep gwk
said he prefer low paid job as long as it is not stressful ig jelpi is the best
option then</p>
