      <p>okay i guess i cant send anything off anon like cc/ns but whatever WE ARE MOVING
HERE AND YALL WILL LIKE IT!!!! I DONT GIVE A FUCKKKK. I basically got an account
warning with linked neospring answers FROM NOVEMBER that had literally any type
of joke i made flagged as &quot;harmful/harassment&quot;... they said if it continued im
getting banned.

so yea there was no way i could stay on there i have maybe 1 month before my
entire page disappears. So im leaving it as an archive üòä also i tested it out
and the block function actually works here and exactly like cc I CAN FINALLY
HAVE FUN I NEEDED THISSSSSS. Theres a lot of great features mond has that ns
doesnt, yes its gonna be annoying adjusting but i dont wanna hear any complaints
üëç</p>

      <p><p>this is basically why im moving didnt wanna say it on there cuz the ns developers are rlly some hoes and cannot be reasoned with üòë. this feels closer to cc in the way that a page doesnt feel connected to a web and im p sure theres no way to send asks off anon so ayeee</p></p>
