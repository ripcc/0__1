problem, majority of them just gf-stans doing their own shit, promoting the
GROUP and not just their bias and they&#x27;re pretty too... i can see why skz is so
deep in that japan pussy</p>

      <p>A little bit of serious talk, japan is not only the second biggest music market
in the world but also got better copyright association than US imo. Their
copyright association benefits all party involved from producers to artist and
protect their rights as how it should especially profit thingy. From business
perspective this practice is japan&#x27;s competitive advantage which I&#x27;m sure really
hard to find in another country. That&#x27;s why those companies treat japan as an
entire different category of fans just like cfans.</p>
