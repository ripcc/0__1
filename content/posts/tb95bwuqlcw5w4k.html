      <p>nah mnh is lowkey evil I donâ€™t see them letting mttw go just like that cungha
was successful but they were still sabotaging her towards the end of her
contract. she had recorded an album and it was just sitting unreleased for
months even though she kept begging them to let her release it and when she
finally left they still didnâ€™t give her the songs so theyâ€™re all unreleased.
they also didnâ€™t give her any of her social media accs. even if theyâ€™re not
planning anything rn i can still see them trying to squeeze whatever bit of
income they can from mttw by doing a solo ep since none of them are gonna be
complete flops that first year theyâ€™ll still ride the jb1 hype (by year 2 though
itâ€™s downhill for everyone)
