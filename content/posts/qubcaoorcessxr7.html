      <p>I donâ€™t even think they will extend till feb for extra shows like people gotta
remember what kind of greedy bastard companies they come from. Plus I assume
evnâ€™s contract will run out at the same time so they can put the yhz and wk1z
together so they wonâ€™t extend any more than a couple weeks imo. The longest we
might get is mid to late Jan.</p>

      <p>When evn contracts longer than Jeb... Like wasn&#x27;t their original contract
suppose to be 1 year ish... The fact they will end the same time as jebs is
foul. Whereas jebs contract won&#x27;t be extended even by a little

ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I know all this evn business is to gather fanbase and exposure for them but
still unfair in a way :(</p>
