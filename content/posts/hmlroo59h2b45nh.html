      <p>i think anon is referring to the tomboyz practice video that someone posted but
idk i wouldnâ€™t think much of it unless thereâ€™s more. today at the fansign gw, zh
and hb were all given replicas of their outfits from that stage so iâ€™m wondering
if a zrose with connections thought to post that unseen clip because of it</p>
