      <p>i lurk in facts to fictionâ€™s dc (dancer who rates idol dancing) and she said zgh
is a better dancer than yjn, a few 0roses in there were surprised abt this but
yeah theyre both actually in the same tier w zgh being a little bit higher</p>

      <p>i will say though i think yj is a better dance (like technique-wise/his approach
to this challenge was a bit cleaner IMO) but zgh is a better performer
overall....that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like hate in kpop spaces when ppl always associate
performance = dance because not all good dancers are good performers</p>
