      <p>Have you heard of the Wonyoung Sense magazine sales drama? Yujin global posted a
data of Kpop artists sales and Yujin is #15 or 16 and she&#x27;s the highest female
(of course #1 is our Haohao). Wonyoung&#x27;s fans are protesting because Sense sold
more but the sales don&#x27;t reflect since Sense has no ISSN. I guess it was already
pointed out even before the release that the magazine is kinda operating
illegally hence the attorney&#x27;s statement because it can also damage Wonyoung&#x27;s
brand</p>

      <p>Sense being weird and kind of unprofessional aside, Starship keeps accepting
random magazines way below her popularity like she goes on vogue, elle in Korea
and for some reason they don&#x27;t get her anything similar in China so wony&#x27;s cbar
had to put out a statement saying they would only mass buy/support top Chinese
magazines because otherwise it&#x27;s just Starship profiting off of her image and
milking her fans.



The biggest issue right now is not even Starship and magazines though it&#x27;s that
dumbass baidu vp daughter who doxxed a bunch of people she&#x27;s screwing wonyoung
over in the public eye for something completely unrelated to wony herself</p>
