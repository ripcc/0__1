      <p>most of the kfans who will watch bp2 are probably gonna be trolls this time cuz
now everyone knows not to get too invested in the actual group and it isnt like
when bp came out when there were like no new bgs to stan, kpowp interest is also
down in general so the cgroup prob wont have much of a domestic fanbase outside
of the ppl addicted to fansign culture</p>
