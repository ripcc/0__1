      <p>I&#x27;m going to take a wild guess and say üå∏ has more influence in the group than
we think they&#x27;re the ones who really push yj and jao as a duo especially in
spite of jao and they chose the song that is associated with üå∏z</p>

      <p>these conspiracies are so fcking funny do y&#x27;all think dh and yh also forced jao
to buy and wear matching clothes with yj? lmao like yes üçÄz is being pushed more
but I&#x27;d say all yhz in general are being pushed more lately with the exception
of maybe rk. like yj and gv have their mc jobs, went to variety shows and yj has
a new solo show while jao was in several korean variety shows, got a new
endorsement and will appear in an extremely popular chinese variety show. like
come on anon &quot;in spite of jao&quot; if we assume yh has more influence and is more
involved than we think then it should be obvious they&#x27;re doing things for him
too? not only as a member of z1 or yhz but also as a solo artist. It&#x27;s so easy
to focus on perceived instances of mistreatment like a duo stage(?) I guess??
but y&#x27;all always ignore the good things he gets. the wildest thing to me is that
it&#x27;s not just akgaes being schizo like always but also jaobinists like why does
that duo make them tweak so much?</p>
