      <p>Girl after the lashings they get from rsns being schizo about everything (and
Iâ€™m not talking actual Center stuff I mean the stupid shit) I wouldnâ€™t either
but tbh itâ€™s always going to happen with produce planet series because even with
bp they never said p01 was center even with gp999 but everyone automatically
knows thatâ€™s what that position is for. The only reason they got away with it
for isna is because I land never did p01 is center like enha jungw0n is p01 but
enha center is v obviously h33seung. Plus I think

Itâ€™s because they are both permanent too so they have more time to rotate and
change centers based of concepts</p>
