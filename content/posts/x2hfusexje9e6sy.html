      <p>en-&#x27;s songs are really so good, they have one of the best discographies among
bgs. i really love their songs, tried 2-3 times to get into them, but they have
such weird energy, i stopped trying after the last time. they are really going
to be one of the groups i always listen to, but really they have such bad
vibes/energy.</p>
