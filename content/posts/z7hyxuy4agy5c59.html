      <p>I sent a mean pc chat to rk today &lt;/3 i feel bad now but i was so pissed earlier
cuz not only did he not send no pc he didn&#x27;t even get his bum ass on that group
live. Like wow you only talk to fans who pay for fancalls? What bout us brokies
who can only afford 5 dollas on you.... we broke but we fans too.... &lt;/3</p>

      <p>mine wasnâ€™t mean but i did send a kinda passive aggressive message on pc to zgh
for not being there though he at least acknowledged the date a few hours
earlier. i know everyone here is pissed and i donâ€™t blame yâ€™all because iâ€™m
annoyed about it too but i wouldnâ€™t put him in the same boat as unc when it
comes to caring about fans like i genuinely think he does appreciate them but
his strict work/personal time boundaries clash with whatâ€™s expected of idols (he
actually reminds me of someone i work with who even if i message a simple
question at 5:01pm heâ€™s not answering til 9:00am the next day ðŸ˜‘) zgh is not
paid for 40 hour weeks though and thereâ€™s things you have to sacrifice as an
idol so i need him to start accepting his overtime fate</p>

      <p><p>oh trust me i dont jwg is so far removed from member discussions in my eyes hes more like a parasite. im more disappointed cuz like we know unc would do this my hope for rky was smaller but still DAMN U COULDNT TWERK FOR US? I think they appreciate their fans but it just goes to show their initiative is slipping maybe it&apos;s a byproduct of being a wkn artists but dang this was a shoddy ass anniv. and yea maybe it is his work boundaries but he can&apos;t apply that to idol life it&apos;s not black and white the whole things lines are blurred and it even comes into question of what&apos;s work and what&apos;s not ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ fhdnndjsjdkdm LOCK IN AND GET UR FATASS ON LIVE MI NUH CARE</p></p>

      <p>jao clocked out from wkn building at 2am thats like 3? hours after the live
ended so he mustve done something at those hours hence he couldnt join, i really
doubt he missed the live bc he /did not/ want to join. yes he loves going off
work early but he appreciates his fans a lot like he literally sent a heart
emoji as soon as the clock hit 00.00 during new year and he always remembers and
celebrates the important dates and all. idk about jw but idt rik, although he is
barely online for fans, is the type who will refuse to join a group&#x27;s live esp
for this kind of celebration and tr too, he literally uploaded stuff to
celebrate the anniv in both insta and pchat so i doubt he didnt join the live bc
the he /did not/ want to. the 3 must have their reason why they couldnt join and
not just simply bc they did not want to join. the biggest problem is wk1 for
giving this live a green light knowing that its not a full group</p>

      <p><p>wasn&apos;t the post made at 2 am not that he left then? we don&apos;t know the actual time and they left in batches but if a random spontaneous live could happen with 0 clarification on why missing members weren&apos;t there it&apos;s going to be framed as a choice matter. it was never a question of who cares ab fans or not that&apos;s not the point its solely about the lack of apparent participation or care into planning and content. but im sorry this is officially marked as yesterdays conversation im over it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ im not interested in debating intention cuz it doesn&apos;t change anything we saw we reacted now we move on</p></p>

      <p>yall are forgetting that they have dance practice almost everyday until very
late times. that was the schedule he possibly had and the other members are not
gonna go live without asking the others if they want to be a part of it. they
werent on the live even tho they were at the company and the company is not
gonna be like you cant be on the live. take it as you will. dont try to convince
folks of your delusions/theories to make yourself feel better about the fact
that in the end, your bias didnt gaf about going live for an anniversary. its
not that difficult. its just another job for him and he is lacking in some
aspects of it. this convo is also getting boring (us sane ones needing to
correct others) cause we will keep on going in circles.</p>
