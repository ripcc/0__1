      <p>Nah his company have a lot of older male trainees around his age that a few of
us know about and that wouldnâ€™t make any sense at all unless they were making a
group for home plus they only started going to older males once he debuted in
zbone. People just discuss njw because he was public but there are a lot of
other trainees in that company now. He probably will do some solo stuff on the
side but there will deffo be a group waiting for him.</p>
