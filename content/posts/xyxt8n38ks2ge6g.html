      <p>I really do wish they had more group content too it could solve a lot of
problems but it only seems akgaes are a bigger problem because of how internet
culture has changed and people are way more dedicated to being jobless and
hating now also the internet wasn&#x27;t as accessible in 2017 as it is now in some
Asian countries and we all know what countries akgaes mostly come from lol like
yes our situation is bad and annoying in comparison to other young groups but
the ot9s are still the big majority and also it&#x27;s a twt echo chamber for akgaes
if you see any ig or yt or tiktok content all comments are all crying and
suicidal over them disbanding as opposed to say kep1er or bp or bts (false
equivalencies i know) where their solo and akgae problems spread to every single
area (peep to that one podcast person who didn&#x27;t even know zb1 had an akgae
problem cause she didn&#x27;t spend much time on twt)</p>
