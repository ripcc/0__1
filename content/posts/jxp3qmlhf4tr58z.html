      <p>mine wasnâ€™t mean but i did send a kinda passive aggressive message on pc to zgh
for not being there though he at least acknowledged the date a few hours
earlier. i know everyone here is pissed and i donâ€™t blame yâ€™all because iâ€™m
annoyed about it too but i wouldnâ€™t put him in the same boat as unc when it
comes to caring about fans like i genuinely think he does appreciate them but
his strict work/personal time boundaries clash with whatâ€™s expected of idols (he
actually reminds me of someone i work with who even if i message a simple
question at 5:01pm heâ€™s not answering til 9:00am the next day ðŸ˜‘) zgh is not
paid for 40 hour weeks though and thereâ€™s things you have to sacrifice as an
idol so i need him to start accepting his overtime fate</p>
