      <p>just checked weibo. some want to send trucks but they&#x27;re really mad rn so maybe
they&#x27;ll change their minds once they cool off because not everyone agrees with
the truck idea. some want to wait until fancon ends and others are like maybe
jao wanted to do kick it with yj since they&#x27;ve been hinting at it for a long
time and others understand that sending trucks would be useless and it wouldn&#x27;t
look good. I personally don&#x27;t think it will happen because a lot of people are
also very against sending trucks.</p>
