      <p>Although if I were a cr*sin I would be calling the police right now....one of
the head admins (and the most notorious one) is in Japan right now and I
wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if she&#x27;s fled with her monies and the rest are all on
their way out. They shut down the r*sin shop also and everything&#x27;s stuck in
limbo and the r*sins are still trying to wrangle out details and ledgers.
They&#x27;re giving them too much time to pull their funds and flee the country. Once
they pull funds all that&#x27;s left is to nuke their accs and then it&#x27;s gonna be
difficult to get their monies back.</p>

      <p>Wait lol this reminded me of something a while ago when people were complaining
about them doing something fishy with money but Iâ€™m not sure of the whole story
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­yeah if they had access to all that money plus all the fundraising they
would have been doing for upcoming projects and his birthday and they dip thatâ€™s
not going to look good at all especially for a big bar like that</p>
