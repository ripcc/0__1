      <p>oh yes ig I meant non official acc twts their official acc has been a lost cause
for a while all those stupid taggings and replies have killed off their reach
I'm pretty sure they have some kind of shadowban cause how is a random
performance vid having 30k likes but not twt pics and also the members never
post shit anyways</p>
