WE GOTTA KILL THIS THIS GROUP ASAP. no but in all seriousness watching this

how badly they want to stay with each other, how they hope weâ€™ll be together
forever, etc like damn i wasnâ€™t expecting a concert movie to be this bittersweet
ðŸ˜­ gv mentioned that he doesnâ€™t know if heâ€™ll ever be able to feel these same
emotions again and that really put into perspective how uncertain their futures
are especially bc heâ€™s right this is literally the height of most of their
careers</p>
