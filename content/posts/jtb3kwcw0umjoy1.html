      <p>Someone in your replies said callins will surpass hao&#x27;s sales. Man... I don&#x27;t
think they can realistically reach 9 million yuan, that&#x27;s like 1.2 million
dollars and most kallins and iallins have no idea about the cmag yet which means
they aren&#x27;t saving. I could be wrong here but I&#x27;m pretty sure a lot of callins
left last year or at least aren&#x27;t as active as they used to be. Hanbin used to
be the third most popular member in china in 2023 but now he&#x27;s almost the fifth
and frankly I don&#x27;t understand why because he&#x27;s had a lot of activities that
allowed him to showcase his talents and charms like AOTM but he still lost
cfans. Anyway, I can see them reaching 3.5 million yuan if they save diligently
until june and receive a lot of donations from kallins and iallins, but maybe 3
million yuan is a more realistic goal. As a reference, cris had one month to
save money and 7 days to buy his mag (not 24h like all of hao&#x27;s cmags) and
reached 3.5 million yuan. This was right after the Keep Running hype aka ricky&#x27;s
peak popularity in china, but callins have 3 months to prepare, heck maybe even
more because his cbar knew about the mag since november, so who knows? But they
aren&#x27;t reaching 9 million.</p>
