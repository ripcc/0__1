      <p>apparently there’s a korean taiwanese trainee who is also one of the visual
trainees and who i thought would be the favorite korean ala janbin and he’s
lowkey a yjn clone but if he’s half taiwanese no way koreans would be fully
warmed up to him right i can’t figure out who’s gonna be the mnet pick tho</p>
