      <p>resident reddit lurker here i saw there was an unpopular opinions thread on the
subreddit so i clicked to see what zrs were talking about and lots of ppl were
saying mt is too cringe with the fan service and rizz stuff like woah chillâ€¦.
like at least mt provides other shit with his talents and nice personality, we
have the real enemy who is jw who gives nothing but then i remembered reddit is
wngdngie hive so nvm, like i was even tempted to comment some shit but #nah itâ€™s
not worth it. one thing that interested me is someone saying mt and tr probably
arenâ€™t as close as they seem (ehhhh idk if i agree, theyâ€™ve never come across as
â€˜soulmatesâ€™ but like theyâ€™re still close) but what really got me was them saying
tr sometimes looks annoyed at mt like aroo? ðŸ‘€ have you noticed that or anything
like that bc i got flashbacks to gyubrae beef and how that was so obvious but
maybe thereâ€™s more iâ€™m missing</p>

      <p>tr just has a resting judgemental face ngl i feel like mtâ€™s one of those people
u just canâ€™t get mad at no matter what so i doubt that tr gets annoyed esp
because he wrote an entire song for mt, but he just cannottt control his facial
expressions whenever he sees the members doing things that HE wouldnâ€™t do which
is odd but ðŸ˜­ if thereâ€™s anyone trâ€™s close to like that then i would say itâ€™s
rk, they donâ€™t appear on camera a lot but u can always see them together in the
bg</p>
