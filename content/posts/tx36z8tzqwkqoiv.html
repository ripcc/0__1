      <p>I swear they got sued by r1s and ruk1dans not only for being incompetent but
ruining his rep I rmb he got into a lot of trouble cuz kat0 invited a bunch of
nugu influencers for promo who didnt buy any products to win the raffle so ppl
on xhs were like it must be sister in law and the influencers liked the
attention and were like i spent valentines with my bf asdkfhaskdljfh</p>
