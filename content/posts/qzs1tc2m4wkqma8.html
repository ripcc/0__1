      <p>listen to me. their boba is better and so chewy and underrated!!! their grass
jelly is so good too. my favorite is a boba + grass jelly combo. the mango
coconut boom is a classic but gets boring but is okay for a first time try.
don't get the fruit drinks (the slushie type). they are way too sweet.</p>
