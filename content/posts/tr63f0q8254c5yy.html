      <p>i just saw a full group pic of w1sh for the first time and why are kfans gagging
over them, there&#x27;s maybe one and a half decently looking members, the state of
male idol&#x27;s visuals is so bad for this gen that these girls are just stanning
anything and zebewon is about to disband so it&#x27;s gonna get even worse :( are
companies running out of male trainees or why is there no more jungk00ks,
eunw00s, Ls, etc like i feel male visuals were wayy more distintic or at least
had different bone structures before now most of them look like nugu bl actors</p>
