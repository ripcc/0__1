      <p>I mean tbh this still doesnâ€™t really suggesting ticketing is a scam because he
mentioned going live the day before so he presumably already â€˜ticketedâ€™ this
slot. He probably meant he forgot to tell staff he was actually starting the
live</p>

      <p><p>ehhhh i mean if theyre waking up early to slot for that day and he went live without doing so its probably not that strict and or the members themselves follow the rules like some tryhards</p></p>

      <p>Tbh Iâ€™ve never thought the whole ticketing thing was that deep I always just
assumed they just needed to make sure a manager was free to monitor the live and
not clash with another members. I mean remember that month of gv doing lives
like everyday ðŸ˜­</p>
