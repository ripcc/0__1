      <p>Is it mandela effect or gwk did say once back then his csat score is enough to
get him to snu? because if he did, his english level must be quite good since he
didn&#x27;t take optional subject and english is quite important in score deduction?
isn&#x27;t it weird or he just got the common &#x27;limited vocabulary&#x27; problem?</p>
