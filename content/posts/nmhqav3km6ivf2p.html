      <p>maybe it&#x27;s just me but i dont really care about c popularity that much?? i mean
yeah if you want to have a career in that industry or you want big sales to
boast i would care but if my bias is korean and have a career in k-industry i
only care about the domestic recognition. but still i appreciate cfans that
support my bias tho</p>

      <p>From a fan point of view i mean yeah, but for kpop companies, brands and in
general for demand and commercial value having a big dedicated cfanbase is so
important, look at all the top idols in korea they all have big established
cfanbases lol especially noawadays kpop companies would do anything to get their
hands on the cmarket</p>
