      <p>i think itâ€™s gone because there was a bit of a misinfo basically they didnâ€™t
make a new scent it was released back in 2024 and i guess the name sounded like
0se so they went with it theyâ€™re just doing a collab with him rn to promote it
in korea ig but regardless itâ€™s still good for him</p>

      <p>Yeah the og wording was confusing but the scents hasnâ€™t launched in Korea yet so
they are launching it on his birthday and for his mag release they did 100
signed bottles of perfume (a different scent) idk why they thought 100 would be
enough because there was thousands of people waiting on the olive young site for
it to drop and the moment it did it sold out in less than 10 mins and the site
crashed and the brand said this was supposed to be a 2 month event may31 to
july31 ðŸ˜­ hopefully they restock because aside from his signed ones all the
other perfumes sold out too.</p>
