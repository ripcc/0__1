      <p>I actually like this question because it makes me think like on the rare chance
that 1/2 leave and the rest stay ( I can even see a situation where yh pull out
zh but leave the other 3) what do you think would genuinely happen. Like in that
scenario of loosing hbn he’s the leader and one of the most popular members so
it’s not like we’d be loosing a filler (no shade)</p>

      <p><p>now that u mention it I could see yh just deciding to speed up zghs chn career if the other 3 are secure in zbwon but that&apos;s where the problem starts. we rlly aren&apos;t ever getting a kepla story because losing a center or a leaders diff than losing some booboo mshiro </p></p>

      <p>hmm but wasnt there a rumour about zh possibly leaving yuehua after disbandment?
i feel like it could be true since he really wants to stay in korea</p>
