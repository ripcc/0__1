      <p>I wonder if he knows not to say it or if it&#x27;s just his non talkative nature
saving him and on that topic I wonder how much mthew and rckyy know and
understand too because everything is so unpredictable with these western idols
they lowkey don&#x27;t even interact with anyone outside of their asian cliques in
their countries so them being american or whatever doesn&#x27;t even add upto
anything ultimately but anyways I think or hope that they aren&#x27;t dumb enough to
know about slurs at least but i couldn&#x27;t guess how far their knowledge goes
beyond that also in kstarnextdoor when rkyy said he feels comfortable near
jonathan cause he lived in america or something and jonathan said cause i look
like them right and ganwok and rkyy went oh thats not.. that was interesting</p>
