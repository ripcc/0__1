      <p>korean men looove japanese women, i read this somewhere, like koreans dating
other east asians, like korean men prefer japanese women cs they’re more
conservative and submissive that the kr girls, while kr women would pick a
chinese guy cs they’re liberal and not downright misogynistics, so
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 jiwoong dating one wouldn’t be whatever anon is thinking

      <p><p>its lowkey been a signifier that if korean men have a fetish for japanese women more often than not theyre hannamy like its a veerrrryyy common match up but its a thing even more so with the overly patriotic krn men too. im not saying just cuz a korean guy dates a japanese woman thats the case but its prevalent in all types and especially the kinds of men youd think were strict its lowkey one of the reasons why kfans hate when idols go to japan FREQUENTLY 😭 also because its more likely they visit brothels but yea </p></p>
