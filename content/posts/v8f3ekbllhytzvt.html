      <p>honestly after lsm was kicked out, i truly think aspa was like truly the last
decently talented group in that company. like r!!ze really killed my
expectations for esem groups, this coming from someone who literally got into
kpop bc of soshi taeyoun and shynee jongheyon . like there was always dozens in
pretty much all groups, but at least the older gens were actually interesting
and they had some kinda star power. itâ€™s not a secret that the big3/4 have been
recycling the same kinds of faces/visuals and certain talent niches to keep
their branding but like these talent scouts really be slacking the talent
portion for some of these trainees turned idols. Ive said it to my friends who
also like kpop but after jb1 i might honestly be pretty much done with much of
kpop like the hallyu wave really peaked 2017-2019 imo and itâ€™s been downhill for
a lot of different reasons since. honestly trying to appeal to the western
market is part of what has been making kpop less kpop, thereâ€™s been some good
ofc but thereâ€™s been a lot that has changed. it lowk reminds me how jpop used to
be huge in the 90â€™s to early 00â€™s before kpop transitioned and took its place
from an East Asian sound obsession. not exactly the same but itâ€™s just a
reminder that we go through so many trends of music, and with kpop the way that
it is, makes me wonder what the next niche market music will be</p>
