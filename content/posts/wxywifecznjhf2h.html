      <p>mayb im too woke but after today cfans are just as evil.... it was nasty for
cfans to make up lies about being kidnapped and dying when actual ppl did die
just to make the situation more severe</p>

      <p>people were panicked because there's a lot of human trafficking in that area. At
one point, somebody did think one of them got kidnapped. wdym "cfans are just as
evil" it's killing me that this is what people are getting out of all this
because there were still people who went no contact and needed help to book
flights home even if nobody died. even if some of the rumors weren't true, it
doesn't mean people weren't genuinely upset or didn't suffer because of the late
cancellation</p>
