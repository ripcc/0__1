      <p>Hmm maybe or maybe not,

In her case zbone will still be active while this new bg gets made and possibly
debuts so she will still have things to update for them. And if you follow her
insta she follows so many groups and goes to their shit itâ€™s just that he x is
for zbone so thereâ€™s a chance she will still follow members but if she likes the
new bg make it an update account for them, or if it doesnâ€™t hit just keep it as
a zbone update account or solo</p>

      <p><p>I considered that but her brand is mnt svs groups so she&apos;ll leave eventually this is the first time both the boy group and boy show exist at the same time so maybe it&apos;ll be diff I hope she stick with hbn till the end we need her but we&apos;ll see. and idk idt she&apos;d use a diff acc she&apos;s been using this same one for everything </p></p>

      <p>Hope she stick with him too because tbh sheâ€™s super useful in the fandom and I
think she will because sheâ€™s been openly posting about not watching or
supporting bp2 ðŸ˜­ also saying the best way to get revenge on mn3t is to give
zbone a daesang so it seems like sheâ€™s locked in</p>
