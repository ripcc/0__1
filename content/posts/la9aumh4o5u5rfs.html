      <p>I don&#x27;t know what is happening but his cbar is struggling, they barely bought
him any gifts and the gifts he got were the cheapest options apparently, also
you know how they decorate the delivery boxes with fancy wrapping or gift bags
with ribbons and bouquet of flowers? Apparently they just sent it in a card box
with shen quan rui written in chinese in permanent marker ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>its rly crazy how ifans have no idea any of this is happening, like if you just
keep up with the group on twt you&#x27;re so unaware of all the scandals on the k/c
sides. like the fact that until that episode came out ifans were still acting
like you were crazy for saying unc didn&#x27;t live in the dorms even though it was
so fucking obvious</p>

      <p>rky&#x27;s cbar is so messy though, you guys know about the mic scam right? he got
mad hate for it and there were a bunch of rumors that started because of it like
if rky is privately contacting that fan etc. and it&#x27;s so funny because noyb and
ris said it was r0sins purposely spreading the rumors to ruin the harib0z
running man schedule because r0sins were jealous but it just so happened running
man happened two weeks after rky&#x27;s bday and that was when everything leaked
about the mic scam and the fan who scammed wouldn&#x27;t shut the fuck up. Then ris a
few months later or something got into another fan fight which got his family
doxxed because they kept provoking other sf ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i fans don&#x27;t know about this
at all and i genuinely think rky just doesn&#x27;t want to give anything more if he
doesn&#x27;t have to to these &#x27;fans&#x27; of his that&#x27;s been causing nothing but trouble
and it sucks for the normal fans who has to suffer</p>
