      <p>why are they still in denial im crying... like matt has done lives from their
dorm before and the couch was clearly very different from the one in this pic??
also looking at dcgall it seems like they already knew bc he always comes to fs
and the company/other events in a separate car while the others that dorm
together come tgt</p>
