      <p>Y'all wouldn't like to hear this but I have been seeing bulge videos of kpop
idols in xhs, they posted that one video of janbin and haehyun during mc behind
where haehyun was looking at his bulge, and everyone in the comments were like
"I don't know who he is but he looks small" probably because of this.

      <p>Yeah, another anon posted it with op's caption and he's a gay dude with a lot of
experience so I think it's a reliable source bc it was a hit tweet with many ppl
agreeing ðŸ˜­ He made that drawing because ig he was surprised how many ppl didn't
know how dick works and judge dick size based on their pants bulge and how it's
deceiving ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ But like it makes sense bc small dick don't got the length
for gravity so they gonna stick out more but a bigger longer dick have more
gravity to them so the fall down and lay flat. As a dickless person I'm using my
hair for example, my short baby hair stick up but my long hair lays flat
