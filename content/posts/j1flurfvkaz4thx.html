      <p>This is so random but I have a friend in common who helped supervise the final
script for euphoria season 3 and she basically told me how Sam and Zendaya donâ€™t
get along because he keeps trying to write concerning stuff to Rue character
(even though Z has like certain stuff to her contract like no nudity, etc etc.)
but basically a recent issue is that he showed up to s3 set with an unfinished
script and very bad attitude but since Z is executive producer now sheâ€™s able to
handle it well. Also Rue d words at the end of the show</p>
