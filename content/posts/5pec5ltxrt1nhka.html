      <p>can those companies at least be:



Tr to EVV/NE

Hb, GW, MT to HB company

Yhz together

Jw acting



That would at least be a better closure. We can have BIVE, BESSERAFIM, BUBUDAN
(this one being EVNN/E), and jw can be kim y0han at least</p>

      <p><p>do not ever type that nightmare out again............. I&apos;ve always considered it but I would genuinely take a jf devil 360 abuse deal over this FUCK NOOOOOO it&apos;s not the wildest guess to make but it&apos;s mkre like jf is a placeholder company for wkn/yh rather than a partnership because there aren&apos;t any of their own trainees in the group</p></p>

      <p>what do u guys think: if hype were to snatch some of jb1 members, which member
seems the most likely to be snatched? using saku and chaew, it seems like hype
has no problem with age(saku was the second eldest in iceone) or individual
popularity(chaew wasnt popular in iceone) as long as they can milk the svs
group&#x27;s clout so putting those two factors aside, which member that hype seems
to be interested to snatch?ðŸ¤”</p>

      <p><p>hype still cared ab individual popularity cuz they wouldnt have gone with skura but errrr idk much ab izwon so idk what thought went into it or much ab hype idols they vary way too much.. they seem to like rich kids tbh so i could see them snatching up yjn and gyv </p></p>

      <p>im not the prev anon but lmao wth are you talking about? chaew wasn&#x27;t the most
popular at all were you even there during iz1 promotions?? i was a wiz1 and i
watched p48 while it was airing and when chaew&#x27;s name got called out i was like
who the hell is this (she had barely any screentime before and wasn&#x27;t a popular
contestant). same with joyur getting 3rd place everyone knew it was rigged then
and the tl was filled w question marks lmao. like yea she got some popularity
during iz1 promotions in comparison to how nugu she was during the show but she
was mostly popular w male fans (same with joyur) but they weren&#x27;t in top 4
popularity during iz1 promotions at all - most popular were saku minj wy</p>
