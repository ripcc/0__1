      <p>I know you dont care about Jaobin but I feel like Hao is doing all of these
chinese jobs so he can later get out of Yuehua. Rosins are mad that most of his
gigs are money making gigs. It is like Yuehua is pushing for these gigs so they
can benefit from it before he leaves.</p>

      <p>anon duhua always does this with her cashcows and/or the artists she favors and
I suspect it&#x27;ll only get worse for zhao after d day. she hasn&#x27;t done that much
for him in terms of exposure since afaik he&#x27;s only been to one chinese variety
show but he&#x27;s filming another one rn and both Keep Running and Hello Saturday
are very popular shows, especially Hello Saturday since it airs on Hunan TV, the
second most watched tv channel in china after CCTV. so yeah she&#x27;s finally giving
zhao something really really good. I agree she won&#x27;t let him go that easily
especially if the rumors about wang yibo not renewing his contract in 2026 are
true... ðŸ˜¬ (2026 too... what a coincidence...) but look on the bright side anon,
if zhao becomes one of her favorites she&#x27;ll give him a lot of elite resources
that will give him exposure along with the usual money grabbing gigs.</p>

      <p>the further zh gets into c-ent the more I find myself detaching from him ðŸ˜­
happy he&#x27;s getting that $$ but I&#x27;ve been through this before with so many
c-idols and the ending is always the same.. and doesn&#x27;t matter how much he loves
kpop if duhu4 has her claws on him</p>

      <p>diff anon but i could see this happening to me too which sucks bc of how
talented and likeable he is to me ðŸ˜­ like idk, i&#x27;m very unfamiliar with the cn
industry, i feel like it isn&#x27;t as accessible as kpop and i am just used to all
the shit that goes on in kpop... idc about brand deals like that either so if
this is his future i&#x27;ll probably eventually tap out faster than with a few other
members unfortunately. i feel like lots of cn k-idols experience losing a bunch
of fans when they focus more on their cn activities so this is inevitable for
him i fear ugh i want him to stay in kpop so bad rip</p>
