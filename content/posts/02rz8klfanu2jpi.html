      <p>if we don&#x27;t get something monday, i&#x27;m predicting the cb will be announced after
this 2 year anniversary video series thing since they won&#x27;t wanna interrupt that
ðŸ˜’ or maybe at the very end of the last video (which i assume is an ot9 video,
unless it&#x27;s a livestream which would be a bit doodoo to announce through there)
they&#x27;ll announce the cb idkkkkk</p>
