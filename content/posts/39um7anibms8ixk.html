      <p>Rps twt is the way it is because they've turned it from what they enjoy to being
better than others.

Jaobinists feeling like they're better than others because their ship is
actually dating, and this gives them the right to shade others contently, and
multishippers pretend they don't have this mentality but they're worse, they act
like shipping these men is activism, and leaving someone out is wrong, I'm
seeing the sentiment lately that if you ship jaobin and not jao2binz, you're a
jyubin anti and hate him</p>
