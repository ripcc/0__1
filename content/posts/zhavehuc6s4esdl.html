      <p>they probably don&#x27;t want their trainees to be stuck with w4ke1 for 5 years but
it&#x27;d be really stupid to add nugus to the new yhz bg. like maybe 1 or 2 would be
acceptable depending on if rk leaves or not but more than that would be
terrible. I get that st4rship did it with 1ve bc only 2 of their girlies won but
yh has 4 members + 2 evnn3 guys, that&#x27;s 6 and it&#x27;s more than enough.</p>
