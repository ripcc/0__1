      <p>Bnd getting dragged so bad on weibo ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ apparently their concert in Bangkok got
cancelled due to the earthquake and they didn&#x27;t notify the fans or say anything,
they quietly and quickly just flew back to Seoul without letting the fans know
so that they don&#x27;t have more competition for plane tickets since everyone is
trying to get out of there</p>

      <p>Yeah I saw vids of them at the airport ignoring the fans and walking quickly it
was crazy and they didnt say a word until they landed in korea it&#x27;s crazy and
the situation in bangkok isnt good at all... a bunch of their cfans who went for
the concert were mad as shit and unstanned them there&#x27;s posts with 100k+
dragging them</p>

      <p>it&#x27;s awful and a lot of ppl probably won&#x27;t unstan because fans can forgive
almost anything but many cfans have been disillusioned and realize that they
dgaf about their fans. people hate on cfans for being dramatic but i would be
pissed too a few cfans are missing or can&#x27;t be contacted and lots of young fans
are stuck in a foreign country during an earthquake it&#x27;s a stressful scary
situation to be in. bnd can&#x27;t predict when an earthquake will happen but they
should have said something earlier or at least been more sympathetic</p>
