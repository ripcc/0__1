      <p>This shat (NBD Comeback trailer) trended at 3 in korea and you still want to say
its not normal that S00bs show is in the trends in Korea? There are ways to fool
the trending lists. I also never believe anything coming from Hybe but thats a
topic for another day. Fooling Yt is Way easier than fooling X after Mosk took
over. We cant lose to NBD... JEBES ON YOUTUBE KOREA TRENDS NEXT

      <p>I still think most voews come from them just cuz Beom had a show and it always
had over 1Mil views too. Now I dont know if Hybe is buying their shows views or
some shot but yeah.. I was a XTX fan (before Jebis) thats why Im kinda
passionate about this whole thingðŸ˜­ Beom got those views even though he isnt
even that popular, made no sense</p>

      <p>"passionate" nah anon you are just bitter. just say you hate jao and go, you're
being dense on purpose its so annoying wtf for comparison, bgyu's guesting only
peaked #9 in yt korea but jao's guesting peaked at #3 and is still trending at
#13 rn so by your logic, those moans liked jao better than xtx's own member? it
took 10days for him to surpass 1m views and only got 59k likes meanwhile jao's
is at 900k+ views now and with 71k likes. yes lots of moans did watch the video
but just like queef said theyre not the reason why its trending. the content
(durian) itself is fun and its uncommon for kpop idol to talk about, thats why
casuals tuned in too



im the og anon who brought about this vid's engagement so its annoying how this
anon keeps downplaying it when its literally a good thing that a jb1's member
(if you do stan this WHOLE GROUP) can get this much engagement and its too bad
that this didnt released sooner. had it released during blue, we might get it
more streams but if anon wants to keep bitter, go ahead igðŸ™„



also jb1 has been trending on yt korea as well, for example yuj's recent jp
cover thats uploaded on JB1'S OFFICIAL YOUTUBE ACCOUNT. why is this anon acting
like a jb1's member incapable of getting good engagement in korea??? ðŸ™„</p>

      <p>what anon doesnt seem understand is that for kr youtube shows like this, you
cannot just rely on fandom's power to get a big engagement; it needs to have an
interesting topic because you might hate to admit this but casuals/the gp tuning
into the show is what actually makes a show popular. just look at hae/won or
chang/sub's shows, do you think the shows did well because of their own fandom's
power??? sure fandom did their thing to boost the views but again, without the
casuals' interest, the shows wont make so much noise just like uncle's youtube
show.</p>

      <p><p>I see like music charting solely pure fan streams aren&apos;t gonna bump up a video to trend you gotta have casuals and diff audiences tuning into bring up viewer variability </p></p>

awkward interaction with the guests like ngl the way of his speaking is really
boring</p>
