      <p>Bruhhhhh these psycho ex zh cbar admins literally need to be arrested im sorry
but that’s not normal at all and im f fuming. Honestly im actually shocked about
the coup the majority of crosins did to oust them but it seems like a good
majority still put zh first so hopefully a little more smooth sailing for them.
I know in general that there’s a good chunk of fans leaving after disbandment
but for certain members especially like zh who have pretty large solo followings
in kr, cn and abroad in general I’d say they have a good chance of sticking
around if they’ve already this invested. I’m also surprised how much number of
his kr fans care for his cn promos cause usually that’s not always the case,
further bolstering the idea that he’ll be fine.</p>
