      <p>Esp worried abt him because he was actually strong predebut, the dieting has
made him weaker snd has to take a shitload of supplements to compensate

( i think gw and mt have good relationships with food in the group, who else?
But jaobin are def the worst)</p>

      <p>Actually this made me think i remember he carried 2 grown men on his back easily
during bp and looking back thatâ€™s crazy cuz I canâ€™t see him being able to do
that now just because of how much weight he cut</p>

      <p>itâ€™s actually soo depressing bc you can tell the ed mentality is way stronger
with him bc he did used to be chubby and probably got made fun of for it, plus
no matter how much ifans tell him to eat he probably has kfans gassing him up
even more for the weight he loses soâ€¦</p>

      <p>Yeah like we all think heâ€™s super thin now but you go to c or k spaces rn and
you will deadass see them tell him he looks handsome thin and that he should
lose more weight. Which sucks because heâ€™s obviously seeing more comments and
stuff from those fanbases than the I side.</p>
