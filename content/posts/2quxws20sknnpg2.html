      <p>I can’t get over how mediocre ge0nwoo was… like… yeah the rumors gotta be true
about favoritism. The lack of core strength shows through his posture and he’s a
little bit stiff. Looks friendly tho I’ll give him that. He’s a former CUBE
trainee too (just like h@nbin) so not only does he have those industry ties with
mnet through being a wakeone trainee but also a cube one (iykyk).</p>

      <p>Not to be a sh00ter but the cube thing never gets me because like so many
trainees on the og bp were ex cube trainees and this gw guys isn’t even a
wakeone trainee from what I’ve heard. At the end of the day, if the pd’s like
you they like you and they will push you through things like screen time and
promo and that’s just how it’s always been.</p>
