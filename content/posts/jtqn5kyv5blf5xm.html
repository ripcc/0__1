      <p>honestly i can‚Äôt see zhg and gyv bond over anything other than their shared
h4nbin obsession sdfghjjk and i wonder what it is about him that makes some ppl
obsess over him like gyv be acting like he found the long lost brother he‚Äôs
never had and if u know the wechat lore zhg went crazy for him like he‚Äôs never
done before for a bf</p>

      <p>As his fan I was confused on why so many people talk about him like they‚Äôve
never met a nice person in their life. But after living in Korea I can kinda
understand. I don‚Äôt want to say people are cold but most just show no interest
and a lot of things I thought were basic courtesy was seen as flirting or overly
kind</p>
