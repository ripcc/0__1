      <p>okay wait sorry anon who said the world tour would take two months here, i
greatly underestimated it bc i&#x27;m seeing tweets saying it can take six to eight
months????????? 👀 that changes things.... unless they try cram it all in to
take like half the time</p>

      <p>wanna1 did a world tour before disbandment from june to september, released last
album(full) in november, and did the final concert in january 2019 for 3 days
after their official disbandment in dec 31 2018 so it&#x27;s probably the same for
jb1. kr cb before the tour -&gt; world tour -&gt; last album -&gt; final concert or two
kr cb icl. last album -&gt; world tour -&gt; final concert. they&#x27;ll prob extend the
activities until jan-feb but def wont be longer than feb.</p>
