      <p>Review; starting with the positives, overall pretty fun I liked the devil game
and checkmate choreos a lot they were def the highlights of the night

Lost it at ma3twook lil dance break although they didn&#x27;t interact much at all
surprisingly

They all looked great like the styling and make up was on point the new hair
colour were great

Bad boy was amazing

The negatives now; I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how much some of these solos
were ASS I&#x27;m sure you guys know who but like omfg some were very noticeably BAD

Both the boys and the crowd didn&#x27;t have much energy but the worst was definitely
at kick it I can&#x27;t even explain the collective disappointment literally over
half the crowd were jao fans (either bias him, r0sins, or 0colas) you could feel
the disappointment in the crowd and him later being like hm we all worked very
hard guysüò≠ probably because he felt the disappointment literally all everyone
talked about around me when I left was why tf did jao not get a solo stage
nobody asked for this nobody asked for kick it girls next to me were full on
cussing out yj because they were saying he&#x27;s a leechüò≠</p>

      <p>Over half the crowd jao fans is crazy jao usually has a big part of the crowd
but that&#x27;s a lottt I can see how it would lead to disappointment in person
especially if they didn&#x27;t see the spoiled setlist earlierü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è From my lurking
on k and csides online though no one has said the stage itself is bad they&#x27;ve
all actually liked it I guess their complaints are with the fact that he didn&#x27;t
have a solo but this is all expected tweaking ngl I just tune it out at this
point</p>
