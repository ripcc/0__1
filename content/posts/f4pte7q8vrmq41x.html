      <p>Don&#x27;t these people know that managers start working on this field at a young age
and they are usually same age as idols bc the companies know that it can be a
little awkward to live with someone way older, even zb1 has managers that are
their same age (zh said there&#x27;s one who is his same age). But bc those managers
start working at a young age sometimes that&#x27;s the only job they can have for a
long period of their life, most of them don&#x27;t have wives and when they do they
actually stop being managers, an example of this being blackpink ex manager, he
quit the job after working for a long time on YGE (the man was also a BigBang
manager during their first years as a group), just bc he got married. Those
managers usually get married way later in life and when they do, they leave
their works bc they know that being a manager is a job that isn&#x27;t compatible
with having a family/wife.</p>
