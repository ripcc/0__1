      <p>Apparently they're paired up tgt a lot and those dh/sy shippers are fed up with
it, feel bad for hj he's just a kid but their nasty kfans are infested with
shippers and always hated him from the start, calling him talentless (like that
isn't the case for most of the group ðŸ’€) and it doesn't help he still isn't that
good at korean, and that kimchi incident was just the perfect excuse for them to
get real nasty with him without holding back, tbh for kfans to forget about a
foreign (especially chinese idols they have it the worst) idol's nationality
they've got to be really good/talented at something or have something unique
about them/visuals ðŸ™ƒ they have to put in 100x effort compared to other idols
which is sad (took ningx2 years for knets to finally stop hating on her because
of her nationality and the hatred is still there)</p>
