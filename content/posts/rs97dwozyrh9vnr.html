"spreading misinformation" anon why are you retarded, obviously according to the
specific location aka seoul, unless you think those numbers next to the trends
are meaningless, "embarassing him and me" i hate when a hater anon is trying to
make their hate seem reasonable by acting like they're part of the team ðŸ˜’</p>

      <p>it will never shock me that things getting questioned always end up being seen
