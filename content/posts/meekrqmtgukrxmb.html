      <p>It looks like Hb went with Fendi and Gucci dropped Jw because of that ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ This
doesnt look good for Jw because everybody felt like he was pushed along for the
Gucci thing but now it really looks like that was the case. Jw appeared with no
Gucci sponsorship TWICE to the airport and both times Hb was wearing Fendi. I
know that Zh has something going on with Gucci China. I wonder why they wont
dress him for Airport appearances tho. Im saying Gucci China because if he was
with Gucci Korea he would have gotten dressed everytime the other two do too or
attended the events in Korea. I also wonder why luxury brands dont want him more
in Korea. He is always getting the Chinese version of the brands. We get tvat he
is Chinese but he is still a Kpop Idol?? Dior seems to have dropped Yj and thats
why he is stuck with Barrie and thats about it I guess when it comes to
sponsorships within the group. I know that Gv got some Prada bag as a gift and
stuff, I wonder why they wont dress him even tho they send him Pr.</p>

      <p>maybe hes fr gonna go to china once zbwon disbands and thats why he isn&#x27;t
getting anything anymore in korea? but realistically this also doesn&#x27;t make
sense because its still 9 months until disbandment..</p>

      <p>3 members is too much for events its mostly always just 2 at most and zhg
already has china by himself it would be &#x27;unfair&#x27; if he&#x27;s promoting in both when
he&#x27;s not even their global ba yet imo their management is trying to balance it
out by giving the 2 the kr events and zh the cn ones</p>
