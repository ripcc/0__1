      <p>i know you&#x27;re not calling 3CE a nugu brand ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ all the korean/chinese girlies
im friends with were obsessed with it especially when we were back in high
school, it used to be one of the most well known k-beauty brands (like top 3)
everyone and their mom had their &quot;smoother&quot; eyeshadow palette. i think their
marketing just sucks now compared to romand/fwee/amuse and other brands that use
a lot of influencer marketing</p>
