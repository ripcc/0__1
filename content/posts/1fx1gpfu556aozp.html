      <p>I&#x27;m an exol and I&#x27;m used to very fun and interactive fancons. Like those men
wore onesies and sang about sex ðŸ˜­ and there&#x27;s this segment/corner where the
fanbase fills out a Google form of questions like &#x27;who is most likely to do
this&#x27; &#x27;which member do you think this is&#x27; and then on the stage the members also
vote with their whiteboard, compare it with the fans top 5 answers and then
debate about it like its sooo fun and at the same you&#x27;ll get to know more about
them. I&#x27;m not complaining but I wish we had a segment like that like this was
mostly a concert rather a fancon. But I&#x27;m happy with this nonetheless.</p>

      <p>wk1 can do it but the members just somehow have this awkwardness on stage like
they donâ€™t really know how to make the segment fun and some members donâ€™t really
talk, i donâ€™t think it would go well</p>
