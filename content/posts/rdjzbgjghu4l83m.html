      <p>his solo also got a new intro and the other members who performed other songs
only did songs without choreography so i get it why would he change his solo
with a choreo made for him just to perform some mid tempo song or ballad without
choreography?</p>

      <p>Not a new intro instead of doing the chorus he did like an extended dance break
but which was like 10 seconds of new choreo but yeah overall I don’t understand
why he’d chose a cover over his own song for this sort of event when this is
probably one of the only times he will get to perform it on stage</p>
