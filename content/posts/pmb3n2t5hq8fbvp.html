      <p>disbandment is basically confirmed 🤔 even though they were all sad and kept
talking about wanting the fans to stay with them forever there were no real
hints at any contract extension, not that i expected otherwise</p>

      <p>I thought so too and in hbns anniversary video he said smth along the lines of
he will support the members on whatever their future path is 😭 not saying
disbandment but basically felt like him saying they will probably not be
together in the future</p>

adore both of them so they could be very successful together(in a group)</p>

      <p>Anon gets my vision 🥹 They would have the Kside ON LOCK. Wk1 is doing nothing
with their duo and popularity in general on the Kside. They could be going all
out on dance and shit too since there would be no bad dancers 😭😭</p>
