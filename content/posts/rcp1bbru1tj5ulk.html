      <p>omfg i&#x27;m so glad y&#x27;all think this too can i plz rant soz i don&#x27;t have anyone to
say this to. all my oomfs are &quot;he/they enby bisxual lsbian&quot; and they get into
the white queer virtue signalling discourse like &quot;enby don&#x27;t owe you androgyny&quot;
&quot;gnital pref is trnsphbic&quot; and calling real lsbians t3rfy but whole time we live
in a religious conservative region.... like dpmo they&#x27;ll be following it to a T
staying vrgin and covering up and gonna get arranged marriage to a man in a few
years like every straight woman. real life already tough my straight friends got
pressured into getting married how am i supposed to tell my family i can&#x27;t do
that cuz i&#x27;m lsbian. then i come online to these online fake queer posting
&quot;lsbians love dck&quot; like y&#x27;all don&#x27;t care how harmful and alienating it is to
real lsbians. everybody is just pretending and i&#x27;m the only fool</p>
