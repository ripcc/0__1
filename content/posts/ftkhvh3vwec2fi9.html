      <p>j-roses might actually be the goatsðŸ˜Œ lowkey haven&#x27;t seen them have a akgae
problem, majority of them just gf-stans doing their own shit, promoting the
GROUP and not just their bias and they&#x27;re pretty too... i can see why skz is so
deep in that japan pussy</p>

      <p>wow yall fr don&#x27;t know shit if you think jfans aren&#x27;t just as deranged ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
they just keep everything private and under wraps same with content (ðŸ˜’) but
when they start actually tweaking they instantly make it a problem because
you&#x27;ll be seeing hit tweets about it omg they&#x27;re gf stans down i&#x27;ve been in
other bg fandoms and members would get dragged for breathing next to girls</p>
