      <p>this is exactly my problem with him. he just lived the moment and just love
whatever he got. never ask or try to beg for more. if i&#x27;m as talented as him i
would be miserable and make sure my fans will send protest trucks and wreaths 3
times a day to get what i want. i lowkey get the vibes he missed academy life
these days. he started doing math (yuck), keep watching those educational
channels, he read books more and limiting his gaming time?</p>
