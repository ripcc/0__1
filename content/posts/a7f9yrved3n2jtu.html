      <p>H@knyeon saying heâ€™s innocent and getting into a legal battle with his company
and news outlets for allegedly misreporting prost!tution is insane. If he is
telling the truth (on the slight chance) then I feel horrible for him. If heâ€™s
lying, he needs to rot. Regardless, this will drag things out for awhile and
will be messy af, especially since the members unfollowed him on their personal
insta accounts. You could argue the companies control those but idk man. Imagine
your company lying about you that you did something illegal and kicking you out
to get a huge penalty fee from you and your bandmates who you grew up with and
liked (at least a few of them) didnâ€™t believe you and you were simultaneously
removed. And this all happens after your entire group signed to a new label
together since you wanted to stay as one and continue being a group. And you
only had one comeback from the new label. Messyyyyy.</p>

      <p><p>hmmmm idk this is so sticky and I was looking at his updates I feel like this is more about what he considers unfair as company treatment I feel like he still did it tho ðŸ˜­ it was revealed through bunshun anyways so it wasn&apos;t his company or a Korean outlet</p></p>

      <p>And when him and the girl say they were just dating and the company got rid of
him ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ This will put the ones who have dated in a very tight spot, an even
tighter one they were on before</p>
