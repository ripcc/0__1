      <p>what happened to hb&#x27;s cn mag? if it&#x27;s going to come out in june like the rumors
say shouldn&#x27;t they be promoting it already? his most loyal cfans are already
saving money for sure but most of them incluiding ifans, kfans, and jfans have
no idea about the mag.</p>

      <p>idt its going to be around the same month new gcci line will be released on sep
during mfw so he&#x27;ll probably be on a golden/silver magz while hbn is on june but
they will still find a way to argue about it üòÇ</p>
