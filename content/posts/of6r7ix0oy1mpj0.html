      <p>ive said this before but allens are actually really dumb comparitively to rsins
I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong they&#x27;re both terrorists but rsins are gaslighty twist
ur words but other than some of the schizos with 30 followers they keep their
drags vague and subtle so they can have plausibility of denial and say things
like &quot;oh so asking for fair treatment is being an akgae?!&quot; whereas allens
especially big ass accs will straight up say dumb things like this in public
it&#x27;s a wonder how zrses only jump rsins but it kinda aligns with the new zrses
joining in talk we had cause most allen akgaes went into hibernation anyone
whose been here since 2023 would know how annoying they used to be</p>

      <p><p>srsly it&apos;s never changed allns will say the jarring distasteful thing in ur face but rsins try to be slick and flip shit on you that&apos;s honestly why they get jumped more there&apos;s also wayyyyy more of them. almost nobody knows how annoying it used to be when allns ran shit ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p></p>

      <p>Right like the allins are annoying af but their akgaes are definitely a lot less
now and the schizo is so open that you can lowkey roll your eyes at it and move
on because it‚Äôs typical behaviour the rsns have grown massively in akgae
population and their whole thing is gaslighting you into thinking they ain‚Äôt
saying anything bad when everyone knows what they mean to say and that why
people get more irked by it because it‚Äôs no so in your face that you can call it
out for what it is you actually have to make a point and justify why you know
they are being asses</p>
