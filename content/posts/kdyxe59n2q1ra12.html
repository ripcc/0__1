      <p>Not a rk stan but I was reading that ex riyangi neo and do u guys think he
avoids it cuz he's struggles to communicate in korean? Communicating already
isn't his thing and having to communicate in a diff language prob puts him off
it even more is my guess</p>

      <p>he does not struggle to communicate in Korean whatÂ ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i feel like some 0s
think rky is way worse than jao at Korean but he's just as good imo and writing
in Korean is a lot easier than speaking it so the communication issue wouldn't
make sense for pchat where he can type and use autocorrect and double check what
he's trying to say</p>

      <p>Actuaaally I think he uses translator for pchat ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I noticed it yesterday
because koreans never use commas when texting, they just send a separate message
but papago translate often adds commas to separate a sentence and his pchat
yesterday used a comma



Natural texters usually be like:

hope you enjoy my music

it was fun recording it for you!

But papago would be like:

hope you enjoy my music, it was fun recording it for you!



Maybe sometimes he text by himself and sometimes uses translator</p>
