      <p>Idk about subscribers but back during early bbl days jao once said during an
audio live that he would start doing a reaction when the live hit 20k, I also
remember another member maybe mtt&#x27;s first pc live had the active number of
viewers turned on so they can fs see live viewer numbers for bbl and pc. No one
has ever said the actual subscriber number though and they all definitely took
hits in numbers from the platform move I&#x27;d be curious to see how it changed from
bbl to pc</p>
