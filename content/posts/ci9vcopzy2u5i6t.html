      <p>Now camping on Weibo and watching the cr0s1ns try attempt number 3175465 to
overthrow/take back control of their cbar cos they&#x27;ve had enough of the cbar
heads....let&#x27;s see if they succeed this time, I theorise the cbar heads has yh
staff in there but the r0s1ns have numbers on their end.</p>

      <p>Eeehh, yh is known for contacting cbars and coordinating events with them so
that the cbar can later relay accurate information to the fans but I don&#x27;t think
they actually manage any cbar. The heads of Rk&#x27;s old cbar were scammers and a
new cbar had to be created by other fans just last year, Yj&#x27;s current cbar
almost quit out of stress, and R*s1n Estrella (Zh&#x27;s third cbar) was created way
before he won bp. The identity of the 3 admins of Zh&#x27;s current cbar is public
knowledge and they&#x27;re just very stubborn fans with huge egos. If anyone wants
tea, their weibo user names are @持证发财 @奔奔喜欢吃榴莲 and @怪力少女梁春娇 But yeah, they need
to step down.</p>

      <p>Holy shit crosins actually did it. The three admins left 🎉🎉🎉 the new problem
is that the cbar has no management now but they opened applications again so
maybe they&#x27;ll announce the new admins soon.</p>

      <p>A full recap would take too long and it would piss me off all over again but
here&#x27;s a list of some of the things that the admins have done.

 1. Being shit with shipping out things to fans who buy from them and taking
    over a year in some cases, some things still aren&#x27;t shipped out and that&#x27;s
    imo almost a scam at this point

 2. Randomly choosing yellow as a color they want to use (you may have seen the
    LEDs before) and saying that it would be a one time thing but continuing to
    use it when it&#x27;s ugly af and zhg obviously likes blue and pink. One of the
    admins also said something along the lines of based on his scandals (meant
    negatively) and potential public perception we&#x27;re not going to use pink and
    they clearly meant his sexuality which is disgusting to say because that&#x27;s
    not a scandal and also what does that have to do with using pink it&#x27;s just
    really backwards thinking

 3. Not publicly posting where all the fundraising money is going which they
    should be doing if they&#x27;re taking fans money

 4. Being shit at fan support for concerts and other smaller zhg fan
    organizations having to bear the load for them

 5. A general lack of aesthetics, sense, and inability to respond quickly to
    fans&#x27; concerns when they fuck up (which they have done so many times and it
    ALWAYS leads to infighting because of them)

 6. They treat cbar like it&#x27;s a company and they&#x27;re the head of it. For example
    they&#x27;ve had a bad attitude towards the artists that do work for them for
    free and in one case changed her art without asking her. When they talk to
    fans it&#x27;s also always in a way that makes you feel like they&#x27;re looking down
    on you

 7. Other specific things: one of the admins used to have &quot;homophobic&quot; literally
    in her bio like you can fuck off do you know who you&#x27;re stanning and another
    admin made other chn celeb fandoms mad at zhg&#x27;s literally last week over
    something THEY did and not even zhg so tldr the admins are all trash and
    needed to go a long time go</p>
