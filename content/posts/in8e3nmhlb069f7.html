      <p>bruh they&#x27;re not even having the members write bday letters anymore (at least
during these lives, maybe they&#x27;ll post them later), just having them do some
miniscule fill in the blanks thing. all the shit involving other members have
been the best parts of these bday lives. first they take away other members
being there in the first place, now they take away the bday letters like WOW WE
CAN&#x27;T HAVE ANYTHING



also whenever i see other groups pop up on my tl with the most casual and cute
bday lives involving other members i get so sad like ugh i hate complaining all
the time it makes me feel bad but C&#x27;MON THIS IS SO CORPORATE AND STIFF, sitting
at a set with different segments ughhhhhhhhh who does thatttttttt</p>
