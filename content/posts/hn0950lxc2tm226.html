      <p>The only interesting thing about a 9 member group is ship content.. When we have
been begging for ot9 content for so long. Right why can&#x27;t these people just go
watch bls or stan gay p0rn stars if this is all they care about 24/7 like this
shit is NOT normal man üò≠ don&#x27;t wanna see any zrs talking about why other
fandoms make fun of jb1 and them and saying we only care about yaoi THIS IS SO
EMBARRASSING I CAN&#x27;T</p>
