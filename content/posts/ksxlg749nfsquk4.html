      <p>and this is why people should never talk without waiting for a lil bit. anons
eating their own words right now because it actually did make it to the top 1 on
bugs and it did enter some genie or melon chart (probably hot100 not top100).
its very obvious what type of fan anon belongs to because ppl saying hb is the
most popular member in korea, shouldnt hurt you this much üíÄ pretty sure that
this anons been waffling about stupid shit over on aestasmoons mond too. going
as far as sending links from akgaes üò≠üò≠ you are not slick</p>

      <p>Anon needs to brush up on their chart knowledge because bugs aside, hb&#x27;s melon
charting was worse than expected from someone who&#x27;s supposedly ahead of all the
other members in korea üò≠ Entering the hot 100 for an hour and falling out
immediately after is not extremely impressive. He didn&#x27;t enter the top 1000
songs on melon&#x27;s daily chart (top100 is taken from this) when other members&#x27;
solo osts (zgh, tr) did. No one&#x27;s saying jb1 are great at melon but his song&#x27;s
performance doesn&#x27;t really say much about popularity</p>
