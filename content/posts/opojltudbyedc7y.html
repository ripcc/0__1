      <p>why are jaobinist starting to act like schizo ryangs about the restriction
sjdjdjdjsjdjdj like have they considered that it might be their own decision? if
there was a restriction then i doubt wk1 would give it an OK about that jaobin
frame in jao&#x27;s room. also jao generally doesnt post selfies with other members,
mostly its uploaded by the other members than himself. and surely both jaobin
know how their fans hate eo hence probably the reason why they dont post selfies
a lot BUTTTT they still do post selfies (there are literally more jaobin pics
tgt this year than jao with jw or gw or mt or tr or even rik even though they&#x27;re
both chinese and under the same og compant). and both jao &amp; hb have mentioned
abt each other in pchat or lives, they just dont post selfies tgt. also not to
mention that yryr duo photocard or jaobin duo for that jp magazine that was
released recently. can that even be considered a restriction...? there are
fairly quite many jaobin duo contents compared to other jao&#x27;s duo, he didnt even
have a selfie with gwook to upload on his bdayðŸ˜’ (lckyz is an obvious push) and
the only thing they&#x27;re lacking is duo selfies uploaded on pchat. maybe that&#x27;s
their decision to protect eo from eo&#x27;s akgaes because there are def many akgaes
subscribing to their pchat. i thought we&#x27;ve established that everything they
post is their own decision so if they dont, maybe that&#x27;s what they decided to?
we&#x27;re only six months to 2024 and they&#x27;re currently in hiatus for like 4months?
so comparing this year&#x27;s duo post with last year&#x27;s just doesnt make sense to
meðŸ˜­ i&#x27;d believe abt the restriction if jao literally posted any duo selfies in
his pchat except with hbn this year but i checked, the only duo selfie in his
pchat this year was with tartar inside the plane and nothing else. he just didnt
take selfies with his members oftenðŸ˜­</p>
