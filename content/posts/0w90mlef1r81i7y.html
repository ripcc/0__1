      <p>disbandment is basically confirmed 🤔 even though they were all sad and kept
talking about wanting the fans to stay with them forever there were no real
hints at any contract extension, not that i expected otherwise</p>

      <p>I thought so too and in hbns anniversary video he said smth along the lines of
he will support the members on whatever their future path is 😭 not saying
disbandment but basically felt like him saying they will probably not be
together in the future</p>
