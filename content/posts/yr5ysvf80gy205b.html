      <p>I&#x27;m so envious of all these bg achieving success than jebs ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ especially on
kcharts too. Meanwhile fans have to beg for donations to even chart at all... Or
attempt. Meanwhile gp actually tunes into other bg songs ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ can&#x27;t jebs get a
song that will at least chart high for once...</p>

      <p>how many times do we have to tell y&#x27;all that kchart charting has nothing to do
with the quality of the song is it&#x27;s always influenced by external factors which
is hype sm payola u srsly can&#x27;t take koreans seriously when they&#x27;ll ignore a
song like dr dr and chart that trash peend song if I say I love u whatever it&#x27;s
called</p>
