      <p>I guess it&#x27;s smart tho, it&#x27;s a unique fruit and getting everyone to associate it
with him helps making him more known

Like mangoes strawberries tangerines, you&#x27;ll find every single fruit loving
member in all groups</p>

      <p>I dont think many realize that it really does get to a point and that its worse
than 2b1nz being stupid and repeating their stupid jokes every 5 seconds.
Everybody by now knows that he loves durian, durian is smelly, most people dont
like durian and that hes trying to make people like durian.... Its the same shit
repeated over and over and over again. Im not putting all the blame on zh bc i
know that koreans LOVE running things to the ground. By the end of their
contract he will only be known as the durian guy and thats it and by only that i
really do mean ONLY that, not even his name or anything</p>

      <p><p>im not gonna jumpstart this argument again cuz it would be annoying my grievance is just the focus its gonna have in their dorm show like we can already tell theres a disparity between the dorms BUT IF I SEE THAT FRUIT MORE THAN GWK IM PRAYING THATS THE ONLY THING HES KNOWN FOR AND FOREVER.</p></p>
