      <p>I can&#x27;t help but worry abt Hanbin because unlike KD he can&#x27;t speak English
fluently.



How is he going to communicate with the non-Korean participators? ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>If it was just korean season I&#x27;d be so hyped but honestly I dont know what to
expect from swf fans among which are people who dont care about kpop at all.

I&#x27;m afraid they could be very harsh if they are not satisfied with something</p>

      <p>afaik they were flaming him because he said he feels more comfortable around the
male dancers in the season two rather the female ones or something like that</p>

      <p>sorry for sending this again bc i forgot to sensor names

so based on the article kd was dragged for always looking at the scripts while
mcing causing less immersion in the show for viewers but um hb did the exact
same on mka so kinda worried for him</p>
