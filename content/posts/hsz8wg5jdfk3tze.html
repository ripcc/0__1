      <p>(different anon) sorry to send noyb but I didnâ€™t want to send tweets from other
akgaes

long story short the company scheduled an interview since people were up in arms
about hrbz missing and hb was the one answering the questions but heâ€™s getting
dragged for his answers. to me he was clearly told to avoid specifics so it
makes sense he would be vague. people are also mad that they didnâ€™t include some
reference to hrbz in the group pic and blaming him for that too</p>

      <p><p>AN INTERVIEW.......... oh my god if thats not the most set up thing ive heard in my entire life ðŸ˜­ it genuinely does not matter whats said to fans when they will decide how they feel companies are barely seen as valid so why would the member that has had historical fandom beef be made to address things gjfijhtjrkfjhfjdsw</p></p>

      <p>i&#x27;m 99% sure it&#x27;s bc he&#x27;s the leader it kinda reminds me when they&#x27;d always made
ch4ewon from less3rafim answer the controversial questions at their album press
conferences like with g4ram and coachella</p>
