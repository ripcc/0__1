      <p>I was kinda away from zb1 for a very long time and coming back I feel
disillusioned about a lot things for example most of the members truly aren&#x27;t
close I don&#x27;t even think mattwook is surviving post disbandment, so much of
their relationship is for the cameras and is visibly very one sided

People used to call mattbin best friends but when you look at them now they have
no chemistry and never hang out either they don&#x27;t seem emotionally close or
intimate at all

Yhz are going to redebut together and they still all seem like coworkers besides
maybe gyuvins relationships with them, luckyz is fake af I don&#x27;t even think
hariboz LIKE each other gyujin lasted two weeks solely for clout....etc

Taerae has no real friends

Haobin beef every two days and have irreconcilable differences

Gyuwook are only bffs when everyone else gyuvin would rather talk to aren&#x27;t
there

Unpopular in intl side but so much of 2binz is just as fake and fanservicey as
mattwook are I do think their relationship is the most likely to last but in the
same way gyuvin occasionally hangs with hui now



I think it would all be easier to ignore and play along with the fd if we had
ot9 content but we don&#x27;t and it all feels sooo fake the members don&#x27;t even
casually hang out with each other besides hao2binz!!!! Literally all the other
sightings we&#x27;ve seen were at work and it&#x27;s so rare for members to casually
mention doing something tgt outside of work people say they are chill coworkers
but I honestly don&#x27;t even think most of these people like eachother</p>

      <p><p>You say you&apos;re no longer disillusioned but the one true authentic relationship in the whole group is hao2binz.. right ðŸ˜‚ yea idk maybe it was best u were away and should&apos;ve stayed that way LOL like this just might be the most shit opinion ab their dynamics I&apos;ve seen in a while. it was 1 thing calling everything faker than fake but it&apos;s another saying they can&apos;t even be chill coworkers according to you and that they don&apos;t like each other.. right.. right.. I don&apos;t even pedal the family garb that zroses love ofc most of them aren&apos;t surviving disbandment but idg when ppl try too hard to have a left field stance either like puhlease </p><p></p><p>im coming back to this and wow its just so irksome BECAUSE U LIED ðŸ‘‹ saying they rarely mention stuff with eo outside of work (wdym work like schedules and recording and shit? or are u counting anything they say ab eo ðŸ˜­) is just dead wrong like are you making this opinion up straight from your head or do you look at the things they say? they bring each other up on lives/chat a lot... like wow we don&apos;t gotta think they&apos;re locked in for life or conjoined at the hip but they def have friendships on varying levels and like each other as ppl, this was too try hard fa me</p><p></p><p>Also how hardheaded do you gotta be to send me an uncensored ask and see my pinned cuz the text box is right fucking next to it ðŸ˜­</p></p>
