      <p>yeah it was op that was talking shit LOL she mentioned it in her replies saying
they were loudly gossiping about other groups like nctwsh ðŸ™„ nyways i thought
this story was cute how the old couple knows rik and personally customizes the
dish for him and even lets him order outside drinks and use their fridge ðŸ˜­ hope
his fans dont camp that place waiting and ruining it for him now that they know
he goes there weekly :/</p>
