      <p>actually surprised that iâ€™m not as invested in b2p as i thought i would be i
barely know the names of any of the well known contestants, this pool of
trainees seem less interesting because of how many nugu idols and previous svs
failures there are. Seems very boring already compared to how i felt bp pre-show
era which i remember was so fun</p>
