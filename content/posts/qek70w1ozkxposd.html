      <p>Girl does gw still get dragged on the kside? I saw a tweet from a kzrs the other
day idk if it&#x27;s deleted (if anons saw it) but it was gaining traction and they
were so upset and said it sucks that gw always gets hate for his visuals even
tho he&#x27;s talented and a good person ðŸ˜ž I know he still gets trolled but I don&#x27;t
think it&#x27;s as bad as it was unless I just don&#x27;t see it</p>
