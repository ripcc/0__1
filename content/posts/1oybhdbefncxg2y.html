since we know they bought from official stores, there's buyer's certificates and
everything and people are slowly getting stuff shipped to them albeit at a
snail's pace. They're genuinely just slow and incompetent as fuck and stuff is

there's no "official" goods to receive if that makes sense, it's something made
by them</p>
