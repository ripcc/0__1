      <p>the new bp2 ktrainee center is apprently a chop and knetz are ragging on him
heâ€™s also an indv trainee but allegedly secretly in wki so heâ€™s gonna debut and
when he does youâ€™re probably gonna see levels of favoritism never been seen
before</p>

      <p>the guy is so boring, i get they were trying to go with a shb center route
(someone with non-divisive visuals and empty past) but.... the guy doesnt have
the charm at all. like they should have just gave it to some talented uggo who
at least looks like theyre having fun, kinda like deyhwi y00jung h1karu</p>
