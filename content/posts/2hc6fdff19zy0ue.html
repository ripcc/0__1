      <p>nta but I suppose it&#x27;s a western - eastern culture difference. Prostitution is
legal in some western countries/states and many young americans think sex work
is &quot;empowering&quot; for some reason so that might explain why anon thinks it&#x27;s
normal for teenagers and men to pay for sex? I&#x27;m not american, european or asian
but I know prostitution is illegal in east asia and south east asia, so yeah,
it&#x27;s completely on hkyn for doing something that is considered a crime in his
country. In my country&#x27;s case, it&#x27;s only allowed if people have special licenses
and are over 18, but of course the majority of prostitutes here are illegal and
victims of human trafficking and exploitation. Sadly, the cops don&#x27;t care too
much about it and men who pay for sex services aren&#x27;t looked down upon here.
Some fathers even take their teenage sons to brothels to lose their virginity.
It&#x27;s messed up.</p>
