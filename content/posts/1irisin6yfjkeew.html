think everyone in the group is bi till proven otherwise 💀 also don’t believe
that any of them had gfs and even trash talked this place for spreading rumors
and invading privacy like bruhhhhhhhhh im annoyed</p>

      <p>istg anons are way too dramatic lmao that dude ships bin and jao with multiple
people including members from other groups like the neos and xtx, but he doesn&#x27;t
believe jaobin are fucking all the guys he ships them with. I think this drama
is another case of shippers thinking shipping = believing the people you ship
are dating or fucking irl. not everyone believes the people they ship are
actually dating lol like I used to be a b/ts, 5sos, and 1d multishipper but I
never believed any of my ships were real... shipping doesn&#x27;t always have to be
taken seriously, people! 😔</p>
