      <p>2h2 tea from xha, jiwxx and yuxx are chronic screen cutters in fancalls. a lot
of fans have noticed they moved the big screen and look at themselves the whole
time. ixx is really nice and cute, no wonder ms picked her as center instead of
jiwxx. ngl i was surprised at first and jiwxx actually has a lot of center part.
maybe they considered who has the most star power and personality.</p>
