      <p>My predictions as an avid nugu bg luvr who knows a majority of the contestants
in bp2 except the brand new trainees, with explanations of what I think will
happen (please save or pin because I am pretty confident in like at least 75% of
these things happening):

 1. List of trainees who will make it in the final group:
    
    1. Junse0 (from WEI, above average performer but he has that BL fanbase and
       he&#x27;s pretty - he has a lot of the same appeal as Park J!hoon and he has a
       good personality - I think most people will like if he makes it in tbh
       he&#x27;s really likable)
    
    2. Sangw0n (former Trainee A, has some support from ex-Trainee A fans and a
       HYBE backstory without a huge controversy)
    
    3. K@ngmin (VERIVERY - he&#x27;s a pretty boy with a lot of hype - he&#x27;s kinda
       mediocre but nothing horrendously bad - he&#x27;ll be an alright choice)
    
    4. The rest of the members will likely be new trainees.

 2. Will end up almost in or make it to the finals but not make it:
    
    1. M!njae (MCND - he&#x27;s actually the second best dancer of the 4th gen but no
       one knows because he&#x27;s nugu and he&#x27;s part of fuckass cultural
       appropriating MCND - his voice is okay but his dancing will likely be
       highlighted during the show and rightfully so, he&#x27;s really good)
    
    2. Le0 (former Trainee A, there will be some type of redemption arc but it
       won&#x27;t be strong enough - for those who don&#x27;t know he made a super sex!st
       and rap!st song and left Trainee A, essentially causing Trainee A to
       disband because he was the main trainee for the group - some
       international fans hate him and some love him)
    
    3. Y!chen (former Project 7, used to train at Yuehua, friends with Ha0,
       he&#x27;ll get close to being in but like you or most of us won&#x27;t like it - he
       has strong pillow face and cannot make expressions because of the filler)
    
    4. B!nghua (Project 7, has a solid fanbase from the show and has some hype
       but talent wise he&#x27;s ok)
    
    5. Lee Hye0p (vocal of group Drippin&#x27;, his fellow group member Junh0 made it
       into X1 but y&#x27;all already know what happened with them; I think that will
       be dragged to paint how bad his situation is and get him some hype - he&#x27;s
       a pretty good vocalist tho ngl so it wouldn&#x27;t be bad if he makes it in)
    
    6. Thanat0rn (member of The Wind, he&#x27;s a pretty boy with an innocent image -
       I&#x27;m thinking he&#x27;ll get painted a lot like early T@erae but he&#x27;s not bad)
    
    7. Yumek! (choreographer, he might get in depending on the narrative he gets
       but he also might be treated as Hu!, like as a fallen expert, but he&#x27;s
       way younger than Hu! and hasn&#x27;t had a solid fall off so maybe not. He&#x27;s
       pretty short tho so it might work against him like with Ke!ta)

 3. Who might get some highlights:
    
    1. H@rry-June (the best dancer in all of 4th/5th gen - even better than
       Shotar0 and significantly better than Hanb1n - friends with B@da and
       other known choreographers - even tho his group DKB is nugu, he&#x27;s
       individually well known because of his dancing among the industry
       insiders and his group has been on multiple survival shows so a lot of
       the normal trainers and likely some trainees already know about him, even
       from the underground dancing competition scene - unfortunately he doesn&#x27;t
       fit a lot of the beauty standards so that will likely work against him)
    
    2. Kryst!an (he&#x27;ll get further this time but not make it in)
    
    3. W!n (another MCND member - he might make it in depending on the rappers
       on the show - he&#x27;s a genuinely good rapper when he isn&#x27;t on the fuckass
       MCND drill beat songs with gun sounds)
    
    4. Donghe0n (VERIVERY - his old age will work against him (he&#x27;s like 30) -
       but he is a strong leader who will get that highlight and is a very
       strong performer)

This is most of my predictions and some background for who I think will be
highlighted - let me know if you need anymore highlights or explanations or
questions about other trainees!</p>
