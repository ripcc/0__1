      <p>Sorry req but i really need to share with someone. This multi-rps discourse in
my tl is seriously annoying me. At least from what i noticed in my tl most of
the poly/rps shippers are the ones who sexualise the members the most, even the
most innocent things they say or do. Also, their defenders are serious
hypocrites, they automatically close their eyes when these people sexualise the
members but will always be there to ridicule when a nbn shipper said the
stupidest things. They could easily avoid them, but no, at the same time keep
their mouths shut when a member is constantly getting sexualized.



Also i am not a gf stan but from now on i decided to support them
wholeheartedly; at least even the most delusional ones know what they actually
like.</p>
