      <p>im ngl i don&#x27;t think jebewon without either of jaobin would work half as well as
it does rn (in a world where they extend without some of the members) they just
balance out the group so well when it comes to performance/dancing/etc.. ppl
love to complain about line/center distribution but there&#x27;s a reason those 2 get
so much and it&#x27;s nawt just their popularity. even with hb being leader like jw
sure isnt providing the secondary support role in this group LMAO
(also im biased but i dont think it&#x27;d work as well without gw but more in terms
of their overall dynamics and variety.. hes the GLUE idgaf) (not that I think
anyone is necessarily expendable but it falls apart without these members
specifically imo)</p>
