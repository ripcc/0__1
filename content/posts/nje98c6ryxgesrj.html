      <p>Given all the eugenics talk this past week, hereâ€™s a list of what energy each
member gives me (race or nationality swap addition ðŸ¤ª because maybe spiritually
some of them can digest sugar or have better hearing naturally due to increased
cells or something I donâ€™t remember ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª)



 1. Jw - that is a pick me white woman if I ever saw. In another life heâ€™s
    acting hella cringy to some white man that donâ€™t even like him. Heâ€™d def be
    the type to wear pig tails as a grown woman to get male validation.

 2. Zh - he just seems Chinese tbf like maybe a hintttt or a summer in Canada
    but thatâ€™s it. I could see him as a slightly masc lesbian surprisingly.

 3. Hb - heâ€™s giving half Korean half Japanese for some reason idk

 4. Tr - that is a first generation gay Mexican man living in the outskirts of
    Los Angeles

 5. Mtw - I think heâ€™s just the same Canadian whoâ€™s ethnically Korean. I canâ€™t
    imagine him any different

 6. Rcky - Chinese American fits him perfectly. Maybe like some time in France
    as an exchange student but heâ€™s for sure a dude.

 7. Gyv- half white half Korean dude or girl (I canâ€™t pick, but if heâ€™s a girl
    heâ€™d get into true crime just a little too much and be slightly slightly
    unsettling with blank eyes).

 8. Gw - thatâ€™s a black man. Spiritually, visually, in his soul and throughout
    every fiber in his being. Heâ€™d go to church at a young age, get into sports
    but be like one of those rare cool athletes everyone fucks with, and heâ€™d
    for sure end up on his collegeâ€™s recruitment flyers with a big goofy smile.

 9. Yj - heâ€™s serving reserved Japanese girl realness.</p>
