      <p>i think conversations about selling power are more complicated than a single
sales #, unless there&#x27;s a big increase in popularity or they get on a better
magazine it&#x27;s hard to increase or even match first mag sales. forex th*8 is
going on figaro rn which is his first top7 chinese mag so i&#x27;m expecting higher
sales but any regular cover he goes on i wouldn&#x27;t. you could try to measure
endorsement sales too but that also depends on brand category and # of
endorsements. for zbwon another thing is rk&#x27;s mag was at the peak of his
popularity post running man when his supertopic checkins surpassed zh he had
like 30000+ and zh had 24000+ it was crazyy. i rlly felt rk might become the new
#1 in china it reminded me of enhyp3n sungh**n&#x27;s rise in china. but now rk&#x27;s
down to around 14000+ and yj&#x27;s supertopic checkins have actually increased and
are around zh&#x27;s they both average 21000+ so things do change over time.

all this to say that chinese popularity and selling power is fluid for me it&#x27;s a
long-term thing to look at rather than the most recent magazine or endorsement
sale it&#x27;s hard for zbwon though because only some members give you enough
chances to even start measuring it. ngl not sure if that all made sense srry it
was long</p>
