      <p>Did you know that according to The8 fans Rosins inflated those numbers by 70k
😭😭😭 They had the albums delivered to some place and then canceled them.
Making it count for the day and then just canceling it. Its all under the Weibo
topic they bought/made</p>

      <p>The whole inflation thing has no basis in actual reality their argument about
&quot;delivering albums to some place&quot; is a practice that 8stars themselves are
engaging in right this minute for his new magazine its called byh (buyunhui or
no shipping back) where everyone in the fandom pays for as many magazines as
possible and the cbar takes all the magazines off your hands sending you the
photocards back but not the physical magazine it&#x27;s basically a mass GO that
allows people to buy more stuff without having to storing it where they live.
Cbars do this for magazines and albums frequently so it&#x27;s really an argument you
can&#x27;t make without shooting yourself in the foot</p>
