      <p>bruhh u no that&#x27;s never gonna happen to the dear cj prince, I mean not for
nothing, as we look back at the last 2 years, for those who don&#x27;t think hb has
been extremely privileged from the v beginning and positioned to be their new
golden child is truly just kidding themselves and his akagaes thinking him not
being able to post everyday is mistreatment when he&#x27;s virtually number 1 across
all socials, and you see him every week cause mca will always be prioritized
compared to inki and mucore (although who knows maybe gyu will have that
privilege compared to yj who we have barely seen as mc). like this is facts that
solo activities related to cj have mostly been given to one individual, and like
good for him, but like this, coupled with the fact he is pretty much the only
one posting on some of the socials (like when was the last time we saw a rk or
zh on x that wasn&#x27;t mandatory) is also what contributes to why no one ever takes
his mistreatment seriously.</p>

      <p><p>pretty much LOL I don&apos;t think my minds ever changed on this once it was obvious from the start it happens in every group ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the akgaes who argued just wanted to be terrible for the fun it there was never a new outcome we just danced around the truth for years lmaooo. </p></p>

      <p>Agree with anon about the mnet prince thing but saying &quot;all cj jobs are linked
to one individual&quot; is crazy works. Jao is just as linked up with cj jobs as
Janbin is and that is simply a fact both sides will have to realise at some
point. About the X individual posts and shit, just tell the others to post as
much as Janbin does. Its very clear that there are no restrictions when it comes
to their socials just a difference of who wants to actually please and put out
content themselves for their fans. We all know Janbins nature, he would rather
die than piss of his fans. I think that Mnet prefers him and sees him as their
prince simply for the fact that he is verd well liked in korea and he has a
thing for mcing. He is kind of the show off son every family has. They are not
going as ham with showing their love for Jao but trust that if he was more like
Janbin (personality wise), they would be. Also most solo schedules the members
get come from Mnet/Cj, the difference is that Janbin and Jao just get ALOT more
than the others</p>

      <p><p>their main idea was in the right place i just didnt feel to correct things like posting cuz weve established thats rlly their choice maybe they meant promotional posts which would hike up his count but its expected with the job. ur right it isnt just him but he still has the more impressionable things from cj these things just make sense with the nature of their fame and how it came to be </p></p>

      <p>personality wise as in a people pleaser? we all know its not about personality
anon it definitely has something to do with him being chinese because tell me
which chinese member of a kpop group who is more promoted than the korean member
in korea? its a known fact that hb is the golden son why still deny it when its
been happening for two years already</p>
