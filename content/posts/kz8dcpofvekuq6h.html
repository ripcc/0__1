      <p>omg we get it you dislike tr but honestly he doesn&#x27;t look much different since
debut? the only big change I&#x27;d say is from boys planet - Zb1 but that&#x27;s because
he was borderline underweight on that show (he weighted below 60kg) aside from
that if you look back into old pictures he&#x27;s always looked the same he just has
a face that&#x27;s really adaptive to styling like him without bangs and with bangs
looks extremely different as well</p>
