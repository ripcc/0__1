      <p>i tried to find it before i sent the text but its hard to find.. i tried the
usual search prevention stuff like just the initials, i only found jao&#x27;s dcgall
and its literally named after a food and they call him &quot;long&quot; i didn&#x27;t realize
they took search prevention that far on that site its crazy sjfhdskfjh</p>

      <p>diff anon the dcgalls are hard to find dfndmndm I don&#x27;t know if you remember req
but I was an anon that sent you gw&#x27;s dcgall link back when you were still on cc
and it took me a while to find all the members&#x27; galls theyre random af i&#x27;m glad
the galls don&#x27;t move often anymore so i can check in on them periodically still</p>
