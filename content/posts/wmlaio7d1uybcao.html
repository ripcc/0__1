      <p>I finally clocked what’s going on. The argument didn’t start because of the kcon
mc thing it started because that dear_gunwook01 account (who I hate for other
reasons) made a series of tweets after mca this Thursday kinda saying when’s hb
going to go gw should be mc. Which I mean wanting gw mc is fine but they should
have known the first bit of their tweets was going to cause an issue, actually
I’m pretty sure I had them blocked before because they set him up before too
😭😭 anyways not saying either side is right but that’s where it all stemmed
from, I was confused at first because from what i remember last time they didn’t
tweak about the last kcon mc announcement but ig this time because they had
literally been fighting the day before the announcement with that user they just
tweaked out.</p>
