      <p>? Wait but if he did say that isn&#x27;t it more like he&#x27;s admitting pc attendance is
by his own choice and couldn&#x27;t come because he was busy? Which his kfans have
been saying all along but his i and c fans are the ones saying he&#x27;s on a ban
therefor can&#x27;t go on pc? So he&#x27;s mocking them instead rather than his k fans? I
hope it&#x27;s true so his i and c fans can finally shut the fuck up</p>
