      <p>gurl this is NOTHING compared to 2022-23 wony hate and if anything this is
better because at least sense is doing something and suing, they released
another statement about legal action again today unlike ss just letting her soak
in all the hate by herself in 2022-23</p>

      <p>diff anon, agree i mean the sense thing i feel like only if ur in the dive
fandom would u kno about it and if it werent for anons here i wouldnt even kno
plus the pregnant lady thing for the most part from wat i seen most kpop stans
dont find a problem with the doxing lmao mayb diff on cside but idgaf they
always so dramatic but early wony ive days even if u werent a dive her hate was
everywhere and everyone knew about it everybody was after her gp, gg stans, bg
stans, arm1es, stay5 even her own members stans hated her this really isnt much
tbh in the bigger picture im glad sense is doing something for her at least she
really dont deserve any of this hate</p>
