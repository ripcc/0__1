      <p>I sent a mean pc chat to rk today &lt;/3 i feel bad now but i was so pissed earlier
cuz not only did he not send no pc he didn&#x27;t even get his bum ass on that group
live. Like wow you only talk to fans who pay for fancalls? What bout us brokies
who can only afford 5 dollas on you.... we broke but we fans too.... &lt;/3</p>

      <p>mine wasn’t mean but i did send a kinda passive aggressive message on pc to zgh
for not being there though he at least acknowledged the date a few hours
earlier. i know everyone here is pissed and i don’t blame y’all because i’m
annoyed about it too but i wouldn’t put him in the same boat as unc when it
comes to caring about fans like i genuinely think he does appreciate them but
his strict work/personal time boundaries clash with what’s expected of idols (he
actually reminds me of someone i work with who even if i message a simple
question at 5:01pm he’s not answering til 9:00am the next day 😑) zgh is not
paid for 40 hour weeks though and there’s things you have to sacrifice as an
idol so i need him to start accepting his overtime fate</p>

      <p><p>oh trust me i dont jwg is so far removed from member discussions in my eyes hes more like a parasite. im more disappointed cuz like we know unc would do this my hope for rky was smaller but still DAMN U COULDNT TWERK FOR US? I think they appreciate their fans but it just goes to show their initiative is slipping maybe it&apos;s a byproduct of being a wkn artists but dang this was a shoddy ass anniv. and yea maybe it is his work boundaries but he can&apos;t apply that to idol life it&apos;s not black and white the whole things lines are blurred and it even comes into question of what&apos;s work and what&apos;s not 😭😭😭😭 fhdnndjsjdkdm LOCK IN AND GET UR FATASS ON LIVE MI NUH CARE</p></p>

      <p>the fake outrage is killing me i can understand ot9 zroes being disappointed
because they want to see the whole group on live but why do you gaf when you
don&#x27;t like 3/4 of the members who were absent except rk💀 it&#x27;s giving extreme
schizophrenia</p>
