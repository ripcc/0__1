      <p>the red light green light game was only funny bc during little yj&#x27;s turn he
asked them to do the thing with the poses... wk1&#x27;s content team really needs to
step it up i saw peend&#x27;s spa episodes and it was so funny they had like hidden
missions and stuff like that I&#x27;m so tired of wk1 boring asses these eps were
like 80% karaoke</p>
