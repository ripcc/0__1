      <p>Shippers who think they are an oppressed fan minority and are super insecure

      <p>Am I tripping or donâ€™t shippers do the same shit lmao? Maybe not entirely on the
same level but I feel like some people donâ€™t realise how batshit crazy some
shippers can actually get esp when theyâ€™ll knowingly buddy up w the same akgaes
causing harm to their faves (which is the case w many big k nlbinists)</p>
