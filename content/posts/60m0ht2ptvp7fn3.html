pretty sure theyre instructed to say this because there's some clause with kcon
that you can't reveal tour dates in LA until after kcon LA is done so US dates
will only come out after aug</p>

      <p>Yeah the radius clause. I used to work for this dj and we would always pretend
weâ€™re not visiting a city or have it blurred on the tour poster. Hope thatâ€™s the
case but I also feel like not everything is finalized yet so itâ€™s safer to make
ambiguous statements</p>
