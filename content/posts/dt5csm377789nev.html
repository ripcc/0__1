      <p>I wonder why so many alln akgaes moved on to other fandoms when hbn never got
into a serious scandal and had consistent schedules for the most part. Did the
truck terrorism‚Ñ¢ era mindbreak them to the point where they felt like staying in
the fandom was too unbearable? or did they just get bored of hbn?</p>
