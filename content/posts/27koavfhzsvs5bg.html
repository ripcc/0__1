      <p>Gw has to be in the group if they decide to debut a boy group. That company has
pretty good connections within the industry. The same thing goes for Hb himself.
I can see in the long run that the group TheLive debuts will be more popular and
succesful than the Yuehua one. Anybody who trust Yuehua is a fool</p>
