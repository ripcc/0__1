      <p>Which is why they have a bad rep among korean kpop fans. Their behavior comes
off as very aggressive and people try to avoid them because they are here for
good vibes. Alot of them are also either brainwashed by cfans or are actual
cfans who can speak korean. You can never trust with what tea they will come to
you because most times its their own speculation üò≠üò≠ How else do you think the
whole new Wak1z thing came to be? This behavior is also one of the reasons why
most kfans dont want chinese members in a group. Most cfans are just too batshit
crazy and think they own everything because they open up their wallet a lil bit
bigger than most ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è You can always say not all but it will always be most.
Anybody who will try to say thats sinophobic doesnt want to understand the real
problem/concerns. Most korean kpop fans think that idols like Yu9i are great, as
long as my own fav is not in a group with them.</p>

      <p>this is how i know anon is not in kr fandom space at all lol kr fans dont want
chn members in their fav group because the trauma former egso-m members gave to
them, it has nothing to do with fandom behaviour because if you&#x27;re in kr fandom
space, you&#x27;ll know all the batshit crazy things every kr fandom has (not just
akgae stuff but the ÍπåÎπ†-shitting on someone you stan- thing is very rampant there
esp in the priv). and not to mention that before chn ssg even exists, kr ssg are
the first in the frontline. so idk where did this anon get about bad rep among
korean kpop fans bc trust that every fandom has these typa fans and nationality
isnt the issue. the only problem kr fandoms have with chn fandoms is about
concert scalper thingy/fansign goers (basically when a kr event&#x27;s attendees are
mostly chn). the bad behaviour in general can be found in kr fandom too</p>
