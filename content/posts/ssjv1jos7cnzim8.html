      <p>they look average and forgettable but we’ll see. Jaobin were great from the get
go imo but i remember people were calling jao a nugu center in the very
beginning like pre-show era but that changed quickly with kick it and ktl stage.
Lol these new centers have some big shoes to fill tho</p>

      <p>C center was in another svs and he’s pretty average. He’s not great but it’s
passable enough to not be a dozen. The only thing that might hold him back is
his height but I can still see him making it into the group because of his face.
Did you see how a lot of the trainees lie about their height?</p>
