      <p>as someone who used to stan nct, kpop idols calling each other fat is just a
regular day for me like iâ€™m so used to this. also thereâ€™s a difference between
calling your friends fat as a Joke and as an insult to the point where the
targeted member looks uncomfortable which obviously is not the case for zb1 ðŸ˜­ i
get why fans would feel offended by it because wellâ€¦ theyâ€™re beingâ€¦ fatphobic i
guess but also like this is kpop every group has called their member fat at
least once, you either need to get used to this or just drop kpop if youâ€™re
going to get offended by fat jokes every time because they will not stop</p>
