      <p>Idk where the account got this from tbh but ik he was trending well today he was
trending in a couple different countries and was 1 in seoul for a while and bad
boy was trending too. I wonder if this was counting all the tweets and
interactions on the tweets too?</p>

      <p>No Iâ€™m agreeing with you I donâ€™t think it was half a mil ðŸ˜­I assume it was
accumulated trends and engagement which is still great but diffrent than half a
mil pure tweets</p>
