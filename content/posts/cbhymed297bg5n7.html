      <p>explain more for auntie ðŸ˜­ i&#x27;m the auntie not you... if you&#x27;ve done any coding
in python before this should be pretty easy

another easier option is this chrome extension but i haven&#x27;t tried it... but it
should clean up everything for you in a csv file that has the
questions/answers/dates/any other metadata neospring has for the answers in the
page (a csv file is kinda like an excel/google sheet, you can import it to
google sheets or excel and it&#x27;ll be easier to search through your answers)

      <p>i ran the scraper for a minute and it scraped 245 questions

just some tips, for action to load more items select &quot;scroll down to load more
items&quot; and maybe try increasing the wait time to more than 5 seconds (maybe do
20seconds) bc neo is so slow. also sometimes neo glitches and doesn&#x27;t scroll
down with the tool so you have to scroll down manually. if you see the start
scraping button that means it stopped but if you press it again it&#x27;ll continue
adding to the page</p>
