love that they dgaf bc thank you wrdc! but also i can&#x27;t tell if tr&#x27;s message is
implying that he&#x27;s going on (bc i feel like it would&#x27;ve been announced with hb
and zh&#x27;s UNLESS he&#x27;s having a role like ch4ehyun did with wake1z where she sat
with them and was giving advice in some short clip before their performance was
shown) or he&#x27;s basically saying that since he&#x27;s not appearing don&#x27;t watch it at
all ðŸ˜­</p>
