      <p>diff anon and jacksahn also said they have to be strictly kor only so i think
its harder for rwiky because most of the ppl he talks to speaks english so they
prob converse in eng/ konglish rather than kor only like goovin, mafew, knewco,
wahnyoung ;) (I AINT LETTING THIS DIE) and jao talks to mostly kor and chn ppl
like hambin, yujhin, that tws dude, suebin, yuchi etc. but rwikys kor improved
quite a bit too</p>
