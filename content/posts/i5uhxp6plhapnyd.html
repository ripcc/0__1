      <p>i think they probably meant who of the zroses will stay following any of the
members at all bc i don't expect ppl to stan/follow every single member since
that feels a bit unrealistic with them all split into different careers and some
of those just won't be interesting most likely ðŸ˜­ i sent an ask like this before
but with w1 they don't fuck with j4ehwan, don't care about lots of the others
and seem to keep up with..... idk...... p4rk j1hoon i guess but i swear they
abandoned all of them except for c1x and maybe ab61x for a little bit. with
iz0ne they didn't really care about most of the soloists or japanese members.
with zbwon they'll probably follow yhz and hb, leave jw and tr, then whatever mt
and gw's got going on they might follow. but yeah i can also see zroses just
moving on to completely new bgs, while some have zbwon as a last kpop group
(other than possibly their bias'/few other members' post-disbandment path) and
dgaf anymore there are others who still seem very active in the fan culture and
are big multis so they'll be sad for a bit and then forget the members ever
existed until being reminded every few months from some tweet or tiktok and
leaving a comment like "omg i miss zbwon they could've been so big what are they
up to now"</p>

      <p><p>ahhh i mean each sf will attempt to follow their bias its just a matter of who debuts asap and how. yea pretty much anything that isnt a group gets abandoned off rip the pd guys who are up now werent exactly up back the right? but yup itll go just like that</p></p>

      <p>I think that Hb will have a big advantage about the whole redebuting the fastest
and smartest thing. He is the only artist under his company and he does NOT like
leaving fans hanging for too long or upseting them. He also seems to be very
vocal about what he wants to do with the people he previously worked with but
also recently. He will have it the easiest. After Hb its the Yuehau boys. They
will take some time to debut tho. Its a Yuehau classic and the sole reason why i
placed them below Hb. They will send Jao to china 90% a few months after their
debut to keep the momentum and i can also see them giving Jao chinese gigs
between the time they will redebut. He is their big asset, without him Yuehaus
would be kinda nothing and yes that includes Yj. Nobody wants to stan a group
just for the maknae. The next ones are Gw and Mt. Mt seems to be luckier than Gw
simply for the fact that MNHs track record is a tiny bit better. Do i think he
will be popular in korea? no, there is no way. Gw could turn it around if
Jellyfish knew what they were doing with him and had a plan. Their groups never
did BAD bad, they were mostly doing alrght until they fucked them up. Jw and Tr
just have no hope, im sorry. Even if Tr debuts with the other Wkz. Tr is their
most popular guy and he is not that popular in general</p>

      <p>Agree I think janbinâ€™s company is going to pull a 143 ent and debut him like 2/3
months after disbandment and heâ€™s going to be super active on socials during
that time too which puts him at an advantage. Plus he can have his own socials
which Benefits him too. Yhz i think will take a little longer and since yh is
sending trainees to bp2 and that ends really close to disbandment I just know
the ones that donâ€™t make it will be put in that new yh group, their only stunt
for growth is I doubt they will have individual accounts and yh may make them
real silent till its coming up to redebut.</p>

      <p>when izne disbanded yna opened her acc a month after same time as the rest n had
consistent activity even if she debuted 9 months after lololol its diff as a
soloist but annyngz did the same thing for ive too. at the very least zh will
have his own ig or even individual weibo acc bc hell be booked the entire
downtime yjn n gyv still have their mushow activities so that might give them an
excuse to open ones up (nd we know gyv will die if he doesnt talk to his fans
for more than a day ijbol) and well rkyâ€¦ hes leaving anw so ðŸ˜‚</p>
