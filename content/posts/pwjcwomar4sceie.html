      <p>in mtts defense he greeted everyone at the airport u can see him smiling in his
fansites pics even at the immigration ngl I get annoyed at it sometimes but it
doesn't bother me that much since these fans didn't follow him everywhere
outside of official schedules while members like zh, hb, yj, rk had lots of ssgs
following them so it's normal for them to ignore these ssgs at the airport</p>
