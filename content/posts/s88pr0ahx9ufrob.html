      <p><p>its a bit more complicated its not the same annoying intl gpds that tweaked him into saying smth it was his kfans who dont rlly have anythign against mtt. one side was jealous and thought it was excessive the other didnt rlly care that much and thought it was funny that he was going so hard. i think the pc noonas beat on him but he was also embarrassed himself LMAOOO hes probably afraid of getting hate too ðŸ˜– i feel bad. so far everythings been smoothed out tho all his kfans r gushing at how cute his voice messages were</p></p>
