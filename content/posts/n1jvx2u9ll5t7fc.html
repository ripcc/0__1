      <p>Lolll this reminds me, ex0’s group cbar just last year got into some heat for
starting a fundraiser during bh’s cb pre order period for some cny support..?)it
was some ambiguous mooncake event i don’t even remember



bbhls (bh stans) saw the fundraiser & got pissedddd and started calling out the
cbar for starting an unnecessary scammy fundraiser during bh’s pre order period
and for not being transparent about where the funds were going (which was
apparently a long term issue w the cbar)



And instead of properly addressing that or just being transparent about the
money the cbar went on hiatus LOL??



This was then brought over to the international side and caused even more
interfighting bc the person that initially brought over the cbar drama to the
international side didn’t properly explain the situation or translate everything
instead they framed it as a “bh akgaes bullied the group cbar into hiatus” and
one thing u need to know abt ex0ls and other members’ solo stans is that they
love them some bh/bbhls whack party so u can image the mess that was ex0ltwt for
that week 😭 until some other Chinese speaking fan properly translated the
situation in a long ass thread but at that point the damage was done and
hardheaded group stans (and akgaes and solos everyone and their mother rlly)
were on their fuck bbhls/akgaes agenda when it really should’ve been fuck ex0
cbar for being messy 😭



Theres more but I just wanted to share this incident bc it’s the most fresh in
my mind lol but yeah all cbars are messy and nasty and the bigger the artist the
worse it is 🤦‍♀️</p>
