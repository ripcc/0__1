      <p>i dont think he knows that you need to play with the cat toys with the cat ðŸ˜­
g1a has sooooo much energy bc he&#x27;s a kitten, so he should be playing with him a
lot but you can see that g1a bites him a lot and is easily overstimulated so
he&#x27;s definitely not getting enough attention... the kitten phase is the worst
even tho they&#x27;re really cute at that phase but they just have so much energy and
you have to spend a lot of time with them and based on every vid I&#x27;ve seen of
the cat he&#x27;s definitely not playing enough with the cat/// being a first time
cat owner is hard but i hope he reads up on it to make the poor kitten&#x27;s life
easier
