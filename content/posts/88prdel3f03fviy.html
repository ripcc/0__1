      <p>you say that anon but ppl still go crazy over x1uh4n and were holding weddings
for them years after l*han had left XO so you never know.... plus larries still
exist too and bnb is arguably, to some (including me so maybe i&#x27;m biased lmao),
more likely to be an actual thing than those ships so i feel like people would
be likely to follow them more since it&#x27;s viewed as a &#x27;real&#x27; relationship. like
sure i could see lots of people drop off but i could also see people continuing
to ship. it&#x27;d be hard to keep being dedicated considering the content would be
even less so maybe more as a side thing</p>
