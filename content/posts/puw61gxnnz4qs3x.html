      <p>Hi yâ€™all Iâ€™m a poli sci degree anon and I feel like I wanna calm (?) any ww3
worries. So, what happened (the US attack on Iran) will 99.99% not lead to ww3.
Itâ€™s a little hard to explain without writing essays but Iran wouldnâ€™t have the
manpower and outside country backers to fight (Russia is busy with Ukraine rn
especially so they canâ€™t aid them, alongside other countries, and some
neighboring countries to Iran also donâ€™t like Iran) and the US still holds onto
the biggest nuclear reserves in the world. Thereâ€™s a huge difference in
manpower. Essentially put, it wouldnâ€™t be a war, itâ€™d be a wide-spread bombing
and killing of Iranians because they wouldnâ€™t be able to fight the US off. Iran
might try to fight back but it would likely be intercepted with American air
missiles and wouldnâ€™t reach land. What I see realistically happening is the US
continuing to do a few sparse attacks as a way to try to drum up more Trump
support (in times of war or fights citizens support their leaders way more so
this is likely a tactic his administration is trying to do to make him more
popular) but I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll be successful. Trauma from Vietnam drafts
alongside scandals will likely lead to the 2026 midterms flipping the house and
senate to democrat, and from there Trump would be put on a tighter leash and
stop the attacks. So, it wonâ€™t be a WW3, and I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll be the nuclear
death of the entire world (I hope Iâ€™m correct ðŸ¤ž) but regardless Iranian
civilians will face attacks and the US military bases nearby will likely have to
temporarily retreat and evacuate until more stability. This could lead to a
power vacuum in the countries where the bases once were. Ultimately, this will
likely affect the Middle East way more than the US, could have implications for
Saudi Arabia, and flip the congress in the US, where theyâ€™ll stop or limit
Trump. An important thing to keep your eye on that is happening SOON with
implications to everything is the New York City mayor race. If Zohran wins it
(heâ€™s a Democratic socialist with super progressive policy proposals) itâ€™ll
signify a forced turning of the Democratic Party towards more progressive
ideals, which could extend to foreign policy. What happens in New York City
isnâ€™t just important because itâ€™s the biggest city in the US, but because of
what it signifies. Him winning or him losing will be a warning of whatâ€™s to come
in the next decade. Whether that be a continuing of the normal Democratic Party,
a growth of the Progressive ideals in the party and a transition away from the
traditional Democratic playbook, or Republican expansion. Iâ€™d go as far to say
depending on who wins Mayor, youâ€™re going to be able to tell if JD Vance will
become our next president in 2028. And if that happens, what is happening in the
Middle East now will be small compared to what heâ€™ll do then. Keep your eye on
it.</p>
