      <p>iirc jao once mentioned in an interview that he decided to sign with them bc
they promised that they&#x27;d debut him but they ended up putting him a bplanet so i
guess it makes sense that his contract is shorter than the rest?</p>

      <p><p>a promise is diff than on paper but idk I doubt that they&apos;d make him sign anything less than 5-6 yrs even if that was the case</p></p>

      <p>I think they only promised him that he would be a 100% shoe in for boys planet
(which they didnâ€™t really keep because he had to compete with 30 other trainees
for the spot), not a guaranteed debut</p>
