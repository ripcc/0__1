      <p>Heâ€™s managed to stay in the top 5 since release day which is surprising since
the other releases are digital monsters, his k fans opened a on streaming team
and even though they had 5 days they raised funds well and I think are focusing
on this chart. But it makes me think with better organisation from the whole
fandom we really could chart better on most charts
