      <p>the last two questions in this article are so funny first they ask jbwon about
their manager show and if they have any rules in their dorms and hb brings up
living with zgh and gv while tr mentions living with gw and yj but they either
donâ€™t ask or donâ€™t include mt and rkâ€™s answer because that would give away unc
not living with them lol. then the last question they ask what they canâ€™t give
up in the dorm and gv mentions having a lot of clothes in his room and how he
doesn't have gym equipment in there anymore but unc starts talking about drawing
and wanting to do an exhibition for fans
