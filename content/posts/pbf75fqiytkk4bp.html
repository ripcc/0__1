      <p>I think youâ€™ve mentioned req tht u used to follow some c-idols before, assuming
kpop c-idols? But Iâ€™ve been kinda curious of just how popular zgh/rk are in
Korea compared to all the past and current c-idol dudes in the industry? Like im
talking all the way back to the hnry l of suju era to the lh/t/kw era of ekso
and beyond? Obviously times have changed with boys groups not having the same
prominent with general pop as before but have always wondered how often times
for groups that had c-members for them to be one of the more prominent/popular
members?</p>

      <p>the last time chinese kpop member became the most popular member in korea was
Iuhan during his 3xo days so i&#x27;d say jao&#x27;s current popularity in kr is kinda
similar to that, a bit less tho bc 3xo during growl era was a national&#x27;s group
(hes so popular that him leaving the group was what fueled kr gp&#x27;s hatred
towards chinese members apart from the existing sinophobia)</p>
