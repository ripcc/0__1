      <p>idrc that wkk1 lied abt hrbz being sick, they could&#x27;ve gotten away with that if
they didn&#x27;t make zh and rk do weird pr apologies and just act as normal/say they
are not feeling well and should rest instead or whatever those pchat messages
were. and just sent yj back home too if they wanted to commit to the lie that
much like ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è there was definitely a way to handle this that wouldn&#x27;t require
2 statements about the festival and the whole fandom fighting bcz of that group
photo and interview. wkkk1 are obsessed with throwing shit at this group
whenever they get the chance</p>

      <p>idk why everyone&#x27;s saying they should&#x27;ve just sent yj home with zh and rk or had
him not perform bc to me - let&#x27;s say zh and rk really did get sick - it&#x27;s
totally possible that they got sick before the flight and it wouldn&#x27;t be worth
them going over and still performing while sick. meanwhile yj would&#x27;ve started
feeling unwell AFTER they arrived in taiwan so it&#x27;s more last minute and they
were already down 2 members so why add another to that, especially when he&#x27;s one
of the most popular members lmao



obv i don&#x27;t think zh and rk got sick and it is some other issue but same logic
applies, they were already down 2 members and yj probably started feeling unwell
later so they had him perform still</p>
