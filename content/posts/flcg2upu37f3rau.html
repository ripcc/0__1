      <p>this is srsly all that evil ginger white demon&#x27;s fault. everything she speaks
i&#x27;m like HOW IS SHE 27????? there&#x27;s a srs problem in the sapphic community where
all the lesbians are bisexuals, the bisexuals are straight, and all the real
female homosexuals have turned to some form of bigotry/lescel-ism (i am gay this
is a very very broad generalization what the fuck is comphet blah blah blah )</p>

      <p>im gay from a conservative town and i figured this shit out in middle schoolðŸ˜­
anyway i get what anon is saying but she gen cant shut up abt her hs boyf, which
makes her lesbianism look like some weird revenge fantasy. plus she was lusting
over some indian male actor a short while ago. like just be bisexuallll</p>

      <p>On some real shit this is super harmful. Some people don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re
lesbians until late in life and that doesn&#x27;t make them any less gay. She talks a
lot about that relationship with that man because it was clearly traumatic and
formative, that doesnt mean she&#x27;s not gay. This is kinda wild</p>
