      <p>could be just my interpretation, but i think they are saying that because
jaobins posts are besides each other in ig so their photo angle made it look
like they are looking at each other, not that they are actually together and hbn
was dizzy after cutting his hand that&#x27;s why he went to rest instead of going out
to eat, he said that in his live</p>
