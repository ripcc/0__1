      <p>Hanbin mentioned something about being with the members and catching a beetle
for them so I think that’s where anon got it from. Would also make sense since
he’s missing mca with presumably no schedule.</p>

      <p>nahhhhhh i think yj's post was before they went off to this outdoors schedule
and would've been when the members were resting such as mt being in
canada??????? i didn't think anything of it when it was posted, i just assumed
he went camping with his family</p>
