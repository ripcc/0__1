      <p>Wanna one also moved out from their dorms 6 months before disbandment so this is
not the first time this happened, moreover their lease will probably end this
june, since it&#x27;s an annual contract. And it&#x27;s also a known fact that once idols
show their dorms to public that means soon enough they will move out</p>
