      <p>Beanice/Bobo said she will post on a &quot;special occasion&quot; like okay....but
recently she has been getting a lot of flak and being posted to those delulu gf
Stan pages because she started a rumour that Hbn is dating ch@ehyün klep and
kept badmouthing him saying he betrayed her or whatevvs yeah so probably lying
low cos c@11ins been attacking her</p>
