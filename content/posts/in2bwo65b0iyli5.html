      <p>They cannot be for real ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ &quot;highest sold out price&quot; ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Who is also gonna

co-fans...

      <p><p>HGJKGJHGFKRGNFJDKFGJG american selling prices follow Asian pricing like if I got a zgh signed album im selling it for a band too just cuz that&apos;s the culture created for rsins everywhere ðŸ˜­ it doesn&apos;t actually reflect the demand it&apos;s just the global standard and right these are probably going to overseas fans cuz anyone would just trade</p></p>

      <p>Okay but Anon what you&#x27;re saying doesn&#x27;t really make sense because if that were
entirely true why are members like mt rk and gw above yj and hb in the ranking?
