      <p>i guess i get that it&#x27;s bc the main series is such a rigid concept and partly
scripted (terrible idea on w*keone&#x27;s part so if zbtv is scrapped fr then good)
but why are they doing zbtving 2 like... it&#x27;s the second part of a spin off
series of an Actual series LMAO it&#x27;s not thatttttttt deep but everyday i&#x27;m
reminded that they really dk what they&#x27;re doing bc any normal group would just
have a consistent, chill variety show like, for example, g*ing s*venteen which
doesn&#x27;t have all these subcategories and rules</p>
