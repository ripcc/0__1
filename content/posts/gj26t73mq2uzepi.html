      <p>to be fair korean is kind of vague so IMO he was basically saying next time (we
meet) can i bring durian to ur dorm (within the context of the jbw members he
lived with not liking durian) as a jokey joke

it&#x27;s not that serious like they&#x27;re clearly friends and it&#x27;s normal if he did go
there, I&#x27;m just seeing everyone say he def went and I didn&#x27;t interpret what he
said like that so I was surprised but I could totally be wrong lol</p>
