      <p>In the small cr0sin gc I&#x27;m in were def angry although obvs there&#x27;s a lot of
r0sin yh fans although a lot of that is def artificial. Specifically during his
ment jao talked about them all wanting solo stages and working very hard for it
and then yj talked about choosing to sing it again but jao didn&#x27;t and a lot of
fans are mad because it&#x27;s not his style of songs and in that gc specifically
there was a unreleased repo last year where he talked about the songs he&#x27;d want
to cover in a solo stage obviously none of which were kick it. All the rumours
about jaos bad relationship with yh don&#x27;t help either. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ll
expose things or take these complaints to the mainstream tho</p>
