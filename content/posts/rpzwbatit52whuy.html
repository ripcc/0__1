      <p>the way itâ€™s in under 2 weeks time and heâ€™s saying this LMAOOOOOOOOO i hope itâ€™s
just nerves bc otherwise wtf are they doing. their planning in general is so
weird iâ€™m wondering if theyâ€™ve been using a bunch of this time to finally film
zbtv episodes when they couldâ€™ve done it WAY earlier considering itâ€™s been on
hiatus for so long ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Mt always being honest he probably is true they got really little time with
preparing for fancon (probably currently filming zbtving &amp; preparing another
comeback or pre release). Why did I say he&#x27;s honest is because how accurate his
review of dr dr vs cruel and I kinda get him</p>
