      <p>i just went on the global search here, searched hanbin and there&#x27;s an allin
akgae who was posting here some months ago. the thing is, it says they&#x27;re
anonymous and there&#x27;s no profile you can click on so i guess that&#x27;s a feature
here too? it&#x27;s annoying though because i wanted to block the person so the posts
would disappear but i guess you can&#x27;t do that, i don&#x27;t even think you can block
people in general unless it&#x27;s anons in your inbox. i tried clicking block this
letter and that did nothing too. does it work if you have an account? that&#x27;s
kinda the only issue i have with this site LMAO</p>
