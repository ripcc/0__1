      <p>List of idols I like when I justifiably shouldnâ€™t:

1. Sion from NCT Wish (played with his thing on live, he insane and hot tho -
his soul is dark and his astrology chart displays crazy things, moreso intrigued
and waiting for his mask to slip)

2. Jaehyun from NCT (fuck him for having such a good vocal tone)

3. â€¦. Super Juniorâ€¦. Shindong (HE MAKES ME LAUGH IDK JUST THE CONCEPT OF HIM IS
FUNNY - classifying this as â€˜likeâ€™ is veryâ€¦ )

4. Eunwoo (canâ€™t act and is very mediocre performer but the whole no personality
thing works for me idk)

5. Wooyoung from Ateez (annoying but sincere)

6. Haneul from Kiss of Life (she gets 1 pass pleaseeeee she may be ignorant and
have a lisp but thereâ€™s so much potential ðŸ¥º)

7. Wendy (she was possessed with the spirit of a white women when she mocked
black women, pleaseee, karma already camee and she periodically embarassed
herself too, she has such a nice voice when it isnâ€™t Christian horse music)</p>
