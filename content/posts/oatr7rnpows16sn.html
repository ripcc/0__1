      <p>yueðŸŒ¸z are everywhere except the obvious one, even in group content, they have
the most priority. i really can not help but see almost every thumbnail has 1-2
of them, sometimes the same people will be repeated, but trust their company
stan to say this line is so mistreated, they will be the first one to leave.
they could have invited ixna, the groups from lapxxe but why their group
members?
