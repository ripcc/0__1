      <p>Ngl I also feel like this is her own fans fault, she blew up with a WLW song but
then her other songs blew up and on a few of them she had male pronouns so
people were like mhm is she a lesbian or bi? and then all her fans would get
angry talking about how she didn&#x27;t realize she was a lesbian, heteronormativity,
something, something when in reality she&#x27;s just bisexual like 😭</p>

      <p>if this is about chappell roan (bc ngl i thought this was about jojo siwa at
first - though i don&#x27;t think she ever said she was a lesbian - please learn how
to click the &quot;further questions&quot; button LMAO), she has come out as a lesbian...
idk i find her being scrutinised for not being the perfect lesbian odd, soz.
like you can find her annoying for other reasons but 🤷‍♀️ i went to a bunch of
interview links bc this did make me curious about what she&#x27;s actually said about
it and they have quotes like



“I’m never dating a man again,” she tells me bluntly. “I’m not attracted to
them, I don’t like having sex with them, I don’t think they understand me, I
don’t think they make good art.”



&quot;Finally it’s like, ‘Oh, I know why. It’s because I’m gay and nothing’s actually
wrong with me,&#x27;&quot; she told the publication. &quot;I just wasn’t supposed to be
sleeping with men, and now I’m a little repulsed at the thought of even kissing
a guy because no one’s going to be as good as girls.&quot;



Roan realized she had a lot of shame around her sexuality and had to do a lot of
&quot;unlearning&quot; from her Christian upbringing.



Chappell Roan used to have “performative” hookups with men before she came out
as a lesbian in 2018.



When Roan was “having sex with men,” she felt like she had to put on an act.
Plus, her experiences were not mutually beneficial.</p>
