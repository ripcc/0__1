      <p>come back from seeing two reddit posts and i am annoyed. they were rightfully
calling out the company but at the same time complaining why the members didn&#x27;t
mention them or show their pics like other times. do they really think the other
members were there to enjoy themselves and had so much fun without the other two
that they forgot them? they are being overworked, one of them was actually sick,
also overscrutinized and cornered by the organisers, who were hoping they would
slip up and tell the truth, wearing heavy clothes to perform when the weather
was really hot and humid, not to mention they most probably received the notice
they had to perform as 7 the day before. can we please excuse them especially
when their job requires them to smile and give fan service even when they are
sick or tired.

fans really forget idols are also human beings, not machines who are going to be
perfect at everything.</p>
