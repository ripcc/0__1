      <p>Jao had one job at Kick it and he didnt do it until the end (High note) ðŸ™„ Why
did Wk1 pair him up with Yj as a duet in the first place?? Lil Bro can not hold
a tune while dancing like that anyways ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Performance wise, yj gagged though. I didnâ€™t watch the full performance but yj
was doing better compared to jao. But there dance styled are really different
they donâ€™t suit a duet tbh.</p>
