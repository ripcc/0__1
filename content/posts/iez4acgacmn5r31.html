its bcus he changed his pic/name to wooper (pokemon zr0ses have been comparing
him to lately) as a april 1st joke the thing is that the pokemons name in kor is
written LITERALLY the same as right-wing (ìš°íŒŒ) ðŸ˜­ its just a very unffortunate
coicidence but tbh ive read the qrts and it doesnt seem they took it much
seriously? theyre mostly just cursing op saying he sounds like bbsongee lol</p>
