      <p>it's not just about being closest tbh they're just also the 2 members who post
the most especially gyv so we end up being terrorised 😭 like look at jaobin in
comparison (LMAO i dont rly buy any of the ban shit but the difference is crazy
knowing they're always going out together too), even gvnrae hang out a lot but
it just doesn't get turned into content the same way

i am tired of them too though it gets to a point</p>

      <p>right there are other close duos in jb1 but 2beenz is just so jarring with their
terror thats why other duos seem lacking (content-wise) in comparison when its
actually normal, those 600yuan contents are just not normal</p>

      <p>? Not too much? In almost every zepisode since 2023 there's always been a
special 2beans corner, on insta every other day they post pictures of each other
in every individual photo dump, there's 2 or 3 2beanz lives so far, there's 2
beans vlog almost every year.....not to mention WHO MADE THIS and 🫴🏻🤌🏻 Like
other than 35 and 19(which recently has kinda fallen off(?)) they're GAS to the
extreme.</p>
