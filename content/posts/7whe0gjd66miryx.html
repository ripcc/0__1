      <p>Tbh people might actually click theliv being the biggest block to contract
extension if yhz fans hadnâ€™t been so adamant about tryna push new wk1z on some
members ðŸ˜‚ the reason they get away with it now is because a big portion of the
fandom heard all these diffrent rumors and while may not believe them still
doesnâ€™t see theliv as a cockblock basically</p>
