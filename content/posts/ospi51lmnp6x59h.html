English here and I deadass saw some kids roleplaying out the scenario (these
kids are 9-10) and it doesn’t matter much if they don’t know the people but one
of them literally said “I’ll be hanbin-san”😭 plus I’ve seen people put his fs
video next to there’s ans imitate it for TikTok’s so it was some real good press
for him here.</p>
