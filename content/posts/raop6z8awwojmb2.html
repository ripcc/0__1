      <p>both two.beanz&#x27;s magazines sold 10k copies in a day, idk why aIIins are even
flexing about it considering that they had months to prepare for this whereas
gyub&#x27;s literally was a surprise project. basically gyub&#x27;s surprise sales = hb&#x27;s
months-long-preparation sales. the result is rather embarrassing bc even hb&#x27;s
cbar admitted that the number is better than they expected??? all those time
demanding for this and 10k is the best they can...?</p>

even if the Cbar posted Wkone not replying to the magazine at the begining of
this year ðŸ«¤ His Cbar didnt even put out any official info about it until the
