      <p>Tbh at a certain point 0 just gotta accept that’s how they are running😭 I feel
like this gets bought up every couple of months and it’s lowkey a tired convo
like there are so many update account that will talk about all members just
unfollow them 😭</p>

      <p>Hot take but am I the only one who actually doesn’t care. Like if they were
pretending to be ot9 then I’d get the outrage more or if they were selectively
like that to one member I’d get it. While I do find it weird they are pretty
openly a solo so like I just don’t follow them and idk why fans act shocked or
