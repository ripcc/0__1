      <p>like there's no way they haven't thought about doing unit lives?? it would make
everyone's lives easier?? first of all for the members its less awkward than
trying to entertain fans alone, fans think unit lives are more fun, staff
members would have less work to do than sit and monitor 2-4 different lives in
each day, its a win for everyone so what's stopping them i don't get it</p>
