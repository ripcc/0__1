      <p>jan was his last pc live ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ then he did a weibo live end of jan for cny and
then another weibo live when he went to ktkt fanmeet on valentines but that&#x27;s
it.



i think the weibo lives were obv wakeone telling him to do it tho because hao
did cny weibo live too half an hour before rk&#x27;s and obv he had to do a weibo
live for his solo fanmeet.</p>
