      <p>Anyone has any idea how well cl0se your eyes are doing? domestically or
internationally



Itâ€™s been crickets for me but I tend to hyper focus on groups I like and ignore
everything else so Iâ€™m a terrible judge of popularity ðŸ’€ but w b2p and
everything Iâ€™m now curious how theyâ€™re doing</p>

      <p><p>Lmao same but errrrr I saw mjx dyed his hair blond and cut it off... I didn&apos;t think it was possible but they nerfed him and that alone was enough to dust their careers in my book they don&apos;t rlly have kfans it&apos;s majority cfans and their intl popularity never existed </p></p>

      <p>internationally quite often I see ppl link their title track when ppl discuss
best bg releases this year (agree) but it doesn&#x27;t really have any impact cause
the song barely has 2m on Spotify after months</p>
