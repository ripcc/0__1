      <p>Off topic: but tws are crazy popular among gays on DC gallery



From zb1 they like hao (it seems like a lot of them see him as top lol), yujin,
taerae, they have a bit of mixed opinions about hanbin tho

someone loves him, someone criticizes him for hetero baiting, someone hates his
past appearance</p>

      <p><p>u answered ur own question but its a thing ppl always try to criticize him ab they expect him to act exactly like his old dance clips when hes not even in the same industry anymore. and these ppl r arent fans of zbwon in any way lmao they just observe and make their own judgement often times crazy judgement lol</p></p>

      <p>Ohh okay lmao I thought it had to be something else bc if itâ€™s just gf
fanservice then id say zh is the worse offender out of the two so how come heâ€™s
not getting hetero bait allegations ðŸ˜­ they need to hop off hbâ€™s dick lowkey
like heâ€™s an idol heâ€™s gonna do idol things including gf fan service</p>

      <p><p>its mainly to do with the dance videos zgh is obviously gay but there was a diff in their videos. and ig u could say zgh still acts similarly? again ppl are attributing entire characters to their videos its not just the dc that does it u see it everywhere but its not a big deal bcuz regardless the largest audience is always gf stans who dont think theyre gay LOL</p></p>

      <p>I also think people blur the lines with gf fs a lot like being nice and playful
with female fans isnâ€™t gf fs thereâ€™s a very clear difference when they actually
do it</p>
