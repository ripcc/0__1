      <p>This is wild like buying hundreds of dollars of jewellery for an exclusive pc ðŸ˜‚
but also makes me think they really want to work with him/ have an official
relationship with him

      <p>More like double digits but sure.... If someone can buy a 600$ watch they can
also buy a 2K$ watch. Its in a similiar field. The real luxury ones are double
digit ones. People buy 2K$ Iphones all the time, buying a 2K$ watch has more to
do with what you prefer to spend your money on</p>
