      <p>idk if u play sswo but if u do i wanted to know if u also have this problem bc
it&#x27;s so annoying. sooooooo often when i play it won&#x27;t even let me on bc it says
i need to connect to the internet meanwhile my wifi is otherwise perfectly fine
on my phone or laptop üò≠ usually when it happens the app will eventually work
after a while but as of now i&#x27;ve been trying to play for like 20 mins,
repeatedly closing and restarting the app and that message keeps popping up. if
it&#x27;s some problem with my phone (which i doubt) then eh but if it&#x27;s a problem
with the app why tf won&#x27;t they fix it and why does no one else seem to complain
about it i&#x27;m maddddddddd</p>
