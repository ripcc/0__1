      <p>it was an rpser saying that some part could be interpreted like they could also
be about mateo but the rpser said in the comments that obviously the song is for
the fans mostly but I mean what did you expect from the people that tweaked out
over it? they do not like the duo and it started from a specific one ifywim</p>
