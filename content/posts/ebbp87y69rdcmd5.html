      <p>There&#x27;s supposedly another tea that it&#x27;s In Bloom that&#x27;s up, but whichever of
the 2 gets picked I sincerely wish luck for those performing it cos both them
hard to sing and hard to dance and to make things 10 times worse you&#x27;re likely
to see zghbn staring at you like they&#x27;re nice and all but still stress üò¨</p>
