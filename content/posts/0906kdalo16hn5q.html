      <p>I don’t keep up with alns so idk what exactly gets said but I’m sure smth
similar was said here about how it’s odd there’s no members with solo
endorsements in kr even ones like hao who sell well and would obviously have the
demand. I’m pretty sure a similar thing has been discussed on Chanel’s page too.
This isn’t me saying XY would have had one if not for a ban but I do think it’s
interesting not one of them has been offered anything solo.</p>
