      <p>Not a rk stan but I was reading that ex riyangi neo and do u guys think he
avoids it cuz he's struggles to communicate in korean? Communicating already
isn't his thing and having to communicate in a diff language prob puts him off
it even more is my guess</p>

      <p>he does not struggle to communicate in Korean whatÂ ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i feel like some 0s
think rky is way worse than jao at Korean but he's just as good imo and writing
in Korean is a lot easier than speaking it so the communication issue wouldn't
make sense for pchat where he can type and use autocorrect and double check what
he's trying to say</p>

      <p>rik doesnt struggle communication in korean but what i notice is that he's v
fluent in speaking but his writing/spelling isnt that good compared to his
speaking so i guess he mostly learns korean from the dramas he watches and
rarely reads in korean. i get the impression that hes more comfortable in
actually saying what he wants to say instead of writing them down</p>
