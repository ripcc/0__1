      <p>Part of it is also shows liking to use it for shock factor it was the thumbnail
for the dorm show and salon drip used it in their thumbnail too despite durian
being like less than 1% of the actual video, I think it'll die down soon because
there's only so many different shows that can milk the concept</p>
