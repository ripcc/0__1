      <p>it doesnt matter if hao is more talented vocally I assure u if it was him
instead it wouldn&#x27;t have made as much noise as rickys no amount of self
gaslighting u to do convince yourself that he did bad is going to change that it
maybe a tough pill for #some ppl to swallow</p>

      <p>no shade but what noise is rk making that y&#x27;all keep talking about because i saw
the members who trended in kr and he didn&#x27;t üò≠ and on weibo only zhyj stage
trended? unless you&#x27;re talking about twt.. i haven&#x27;t really seen any of them get
a hit tweet but i&#x27;m sure fans loved his stage anyway</p>
