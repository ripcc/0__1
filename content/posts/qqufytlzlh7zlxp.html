      <p>this reminds me of how the same thing happened with s*v*nteen, a member didn&#x27;t
know about another member&#x27;s ost in a very popular k-drama but then again them
and zbwon are pretty different groups.. ðŸ˜­ some people in the qrts are clocking
it tho they&#x27;re like &quot;uhhhhhhh do they not talk outside of work hours?&quot;</p>
