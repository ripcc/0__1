      <p>i wonder what post-disbandment is gonna be like with member perceptions bc i
know with w1 i think w4nnables hate j43hwan, especially with that drama with him
claiming j1nyoung was being bullied by c1x but idk if they felt/expressed this
during the group's run, there's probably similar with exwon, i don't think the
produce ggs have really experienced that so i think it's a bg fanbase thing ðŸ˜­
like who are zroses gonna still rock with, who will they drop (this is more like
w1zones since none of them gaf about the j members minus s4kura and then i don't
think they really care about the non-le ss3rafim/1ve members now that i think
about it other than like y3na? i'd say tr is gonna fall into this but i wonder
if other members will) and are they gonna admit to secretly hating members bc i
had a vision of this happening with jw the day right after disbandment, like
everyone just airing their grievances out LMAO</p>

      <p>not that this is the main reason why w1zones hates 1ve anymore but early
post-disbandment they were getting the most shit for disbanding 1zone and
w1zones refused to let that go. 1ve would breathe and the replies would say fuck
st4rsh1p and 1ve for disbanding 1zone, this is why d1ves and w1zones don't fuck
with each other</p>
