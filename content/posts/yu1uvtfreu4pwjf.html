      <p>diff anon but kinda funny because i feel like gyu and rk aint as close either
and rather matt and rk got closer because multiple times now (fansign and the
recent jpn mag) rk has mentioned matts the one he relies on and goes to when
having a hard time and talks the most with because they share the same interest
and humor. I always felt rk vibed with americans/ na ppl more since bp because
he was always around kamden and jay so now I wonder if he's closer with matt
than gyu but maybe they close in their own different ways idk

      <p><p>okay so I see that recency bias is killing yall cuz there is no universe where rky and mtt are closer than gyvrky ðŸ˜­ i think we talked ab it on ns but they&apos;re as close as ever they&apos;re just not showing it. he can still be close to mtt and have a diff relationship w him but it doesn&apos;t dismiss his friendship w his closest friend</p></p>
