      <p>This is wild like buying hundreds of dollars of jewellery for an exclusive pc ðŸ˜‚
but also makes me think they really want to work with him/ have an official
relationship with him

      <p>man this talk about swarovski not being as expensive as other luxury brands
reminded me of this cursed -hypen tweet. I hope things don&#x27;t get as bad here
because imagine thinking wearing swarovski is some kind of &quot;mistreatment&quot; ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
-hypen fans are mentally ill
