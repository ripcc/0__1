they pooled funds for allure and until now its still isnt sold outðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… But since
his cfans were begging for this i expect that they would at least surpass yj
after all he has zerocolas to contribute a likkle</p>

      <p>it won&#x27;t be a gag even if he reaches yj&#x27;s sales like they&#x27;ve known about this
mag for almost half a year idt i&#x27;ve ever heard of anything like that ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it&#x27;d
be insanely embarassing if he doesn&#x27;t the way his cfans act</p>

      <p>Tbh they only knew it was a mag since like yesterday? Most of them assumed the
job just fell through because even the person in the screenshots was saying if
