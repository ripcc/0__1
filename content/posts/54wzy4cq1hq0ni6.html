      <p>Heâ€™s managed to stay in the top 5 since release day which is surprising since
the other releases are digital monsters, his k fans opened a on streaming team
and even though they had 5 days they raised funds well and I think are focusing
on this chart. But it makes me think with better organisation from the whole
fandom we really could chart better on most charts

      <p>What are you even talking about anon lmfao if you&#x27;re not charting anywhere and
focusing on one chart that relies on mass downloading and funds ofc you&#x27;re gonna
hit 1 and then free fall when fans aren&#x27;t mass downloading .. acting like jb1&#x27;s
biggest concern is fuckass bugs ðŸ˜­</p>
