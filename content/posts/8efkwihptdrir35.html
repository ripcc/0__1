      <p>I think something went on but I doubt a schedule since they were all supposed to
fly back together plus I doubt they‚Äôve booked in anything for hb. When he‚Äôs been
mcing for 3 days and was loosing his voice by day 3</p>

      <p>Hb mentioned he had a different schedule and that he stayed and extra day to
rest and he‚Äôs filming smth. My guess is it‚Äôs probably the same thing my zh and
gw filmed a couple days ago.</p>

      <p>Someone on moons page actually mentioned it might be a vlog like thing like they
did for the 2nd anniversary because members had a day off and mentioned filming
vlogs on Saturday when hb was mcing and gv was at mucore so it makes sense if
that‚Äôs why those two stayed back an extra day to film that.</p>
