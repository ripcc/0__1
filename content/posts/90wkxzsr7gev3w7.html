      <p>I think youâ€™ve mentioned req tht u used to follow some c-idols before, assuming
kpop c-idols? But Iâ€™ve been kinda curious of just how popular zgh/rk are in
Korea compared to all the past and current c-idol dudes in the industry? Like im
talking all the way back to the hnry l of suju era to the lh/t/kw era of ekso
and beyond? Obviously times have changed with boys groups not having the same
prominent with general pop as before but have always wondered how often times
for groups that had c-members for them to be one of the more prominent/popular
members?</p>

      <p><p>only ww and wavey so not exactly the same ðŸ˜­ and they&apos;re majorly unpopular in China. Mmm I can only speak for nst kiiinda i unstanned like 5 yrs ago but both ww and rj were fairly popular. ww was liked by general kfans and one of the most expensive members if im rmbring correctly and rjs always been a top dream member just not in a while LOL idk too much ab this tho</p></p>

      <p>among male idols i feel like jackson is still the most well known in sk bc of
variety shows but he is from hk and they treat the ones who came from main land
differently i would say rk could be similar to ww who is pretty well loved in
both countries but not much huge fandoms in both. but we really cant compare bc
popular chinese idols only cone from big companies while zb1 isnt. and they were
never the most popular among their group while zhg is for zbwon and zhg is
probably the first male cn kpop idol ive seen to have both massive fandom in kr
and china bc most of the time its only either of the two</p>

like jksn bcs he is not funny??? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­beside him being from hk, fans of other
members of his group are not always on his ass in all ksites and makes the
nonfans feel weird seeing the fandom dynamics</p>
