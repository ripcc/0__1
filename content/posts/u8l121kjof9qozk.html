they pooled funds for allure and until now its still isnt sold outðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… But since
his cfans were begging for this i expect that they would at least surpass yj
after all he has zerocolas to contribute a likkle</p>

      <p>it won't be a gag even if he reaches yj's sales like they've known about this
mag for almost half a year idt i've ever heard of anything like that ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it'd
be insanely embarassing if he doesn't the way his cfans act</p>
