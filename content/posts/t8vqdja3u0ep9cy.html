      <p>I saw someone else say this but Iâ€™d like to know people opinions on this. They
said that the reason 0s and even solos and akgaes with ship him with anyone is
not because of a perceived image but because deep down most these people are gf
stans and will make a situation sexual/ romantic to self insert</p>

      <p><p>ðŸ¤” hmmmmm i see where ur going but i think its def the image thing that precedes that. gf stanning and shipping has always been intertwined but you only see this w idols who r dubbed the thotty members. like all those nasty mtt harem fans act liek that cuz they rlly think thats his vibe </p></p>

      <p>It's because normal fans don't take shipping seriously unlike the people who are
foaming at the mouth about "monogamy" because they're THAT emotionally attached
and desperate to prove the validity of their ship</p>
