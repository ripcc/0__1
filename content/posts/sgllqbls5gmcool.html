      <p>honestly i can‚Äôt see zhg and gyv bond over anything other than their shared
h4nbin obsession sdfghjjk and i wonder what it is about him that makes some ppl
obsess over him like gyv be acting like he found the long lost brother he‚Äôs
never had and if u know the wechat lore zhg went crazy for him like he‚Äôs never
done before for a bf</p>

      <p>yea zhg and gyv are def close now even without hbn being there but they
definitely got closer through him and hanging as a trio lol even more since they
moved out.

they already gave off a kind of brotherly energy in bp if u paid attention but
there was distance there for sure, now he&#x27;s actually one of the 3 ppl zhg hangs
out with</p>
