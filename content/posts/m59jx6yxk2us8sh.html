      <p>Review; starting with the positives, overall pretty fun I liked the devil game
and checkmate choreos a lot they were def the highlights of the night

Lost it at ma3twook lil dance break although they didn&#x27;t interact much at all
surprisingly

They all looked great like the styling and make up was on point the new hair
colour were great

Bad boy was amazing

The negatives now; I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how much some of these solos
were ASS I&#x27;m sure you guys know who but like omfg some were very noticeably BAD

Both the boys and the crowd didn&#x27;t have much energy but the worst was definitely
at kick it I can&#x27;t even explain the collective disappointment literally over
half the crowd were jao fans (either bias him, r0sins, or 0colas) you could feel
the disappointment in the crowd and him later being like hm we all worked very
hard guysðŸ˜­ probably because he felt the disappointment literally all everyone
talked about around me when I left was why tf did jao not get a solo stage
nobody asked for this nobody asked for kick it girls next to me were full on
cussing out yj because they were saying he&#x27;s a leechðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Moot who went told me the exact same thing she liked it though and had fun like
for jbw standards it was good but she also said the lack of energy could be felt
and that a lot of people were very visibly disappointed</p>
