      <p>since full album has like 8-12 songs maybe they&#x27;ll include solo songs they
mentioned they recorded for so long ðŸ˜€ this is worse than unit songs ðŸ˜€ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>nahhhh, someone asked tr something about solo songs during tour and he basically
let them down saying there wouldn&#x27;t be time or something, and i rly think they&#x27;d
take the opportunity to perform them if they were recording them

duo/unit i can see tho</p>
