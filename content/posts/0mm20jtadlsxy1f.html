      <p>og anon here i don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re &quot;letting him go&quot; necessarily he initially had
something called a shadow contract and signed some other contract (not an artist
one) when he debuted in jebi1. if he were to stay in yh he would have to sign a
new contract but by all means he&#x27;s lowk definitely not going to, it&#x27;s also
speculated that their giving him so many sponsorships with no real logic behind
the branding is because they want to make as much money off him as they can
before he leaves.. again this is pretty common knowledge with crosins. i&#x27;m
obviously not talking about casual fans though like these are the ones that get
down</p>

      <p>I&#x27;m glad everyone knows about it so now we can speculate about it here too lol I
haven&#x27;t heard of any rumours of jao thinking of signing to any other companies,
but I also struggle to see him extending his contract to yh</p>
