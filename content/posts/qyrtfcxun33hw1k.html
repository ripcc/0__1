      <p>i&#x27;m ngl i genuinely thought they were gonna have w4nna 0ne fame LMAOOOOOOOO (i
was a kpop fan during their run but i wasn&#x27;t a w4nnable and i feel like they
stayed in their own bubble despite them being big in korea so i didn&#x27;t, and
still don&#x27;t, have the greatest concept of what exactly their popularity was
like). like i know people said to not really expect that but the way their
popularity during b0ys pl4net with all the public appearances at fan projects
was (and for eg when yhz celebrated 0llie&#x27;s birthday.. a day to remember) and
how it felt like they were the talk of the town about i was genuinely hopeful
that they&#x27;d be at least pretty well liked by the gp ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ that
quickly changed though</p>

      <p><p>BRO DONT EVEN GET ME STARTEDDDD WE WERE PROMISED WANNATWO NOT THIS ðŸ˜­.. i genuinely held some resentment for the group pre ftp cuz i felt so catfished how dare they ruin my first survival show experience ðŸ˜’ from what ive learned wnnaone started off with insane popularity like peak xo/btc popularity that the fall off didnt even matter cuz its inevitable. but yessss their april popularity during the show was insane i rmbr they ahd fans OUTSIDE the arena where the finale was it was insanity they were even surpassing producex likes on melon and charting with show songs.. liek what happened.. what went wrong.. they were big enough to make big4 companies nervous.. ik ppl say the management from all the produce groups and zbwon were the same but i cant help but feeling like it rlly wasnt. we got a company that was known to plunder their FAILED chop groups a company that had SHARTPLER.. and all their detrimental mistakes were solely due to their lack of preparedness and resources WE WERE DEALT SHIT CARDS ðŸ¤¬ </p></p>

      <p>angtakjung really ruined zbwon&#x27;s rep among general public. whenever i see the
comment section of the members&#x27; viral shorts, theres always. i repeat, ALWAYS, a
comment thats like &quot;i wanted to stan them but i didnt bc of angtakjung&quot;, thats
literally how the gp perceives zbwon now and ever since that, its hard to gain
new fans (crush was a huge miss among the gp but there are still new fans who
were willing to join the fandom and crush literally charted higher than any
title tracks released after the angtakjung scandal broke). the way wkone handled
that scandal was shit too, like instead of making him apologize they fueled the
situation by dropping a lawsuit notice and letting him post that bbl message
which ended up becoming the national meme of 2024, dragging the problem even
furtherðŸ˜’</p>

      <p><p>it was the finishing move.. there were pre-existing issue with general kpop fans but he solidified them in a bucket of shit... its rlly bad like the worst of it has stopped but it was so terrible to begin with THAT ITS STILL BOOBOO NOW.. i started getting krn local tiktoks on my fyp and the amt of angdkjng users ive seen in the comments is crazy and the videos have nothing to do with kpop, like its just a &quot;thing&quot; now and itll never go awayyy ðŸ’” ik it feels bleak but they did gain new fans and not just internationally idk what voodoo they conjured but they did it somehow. id say half the kfandom is new fans, it helps that theyre younger so they care less and these are the girls that get down to stream, but their general image isnt the best. wow zbwon are just victims they created a new era of troll kfans that abuse them to no end its kinda died down but still they cant live shit down</p></p>
