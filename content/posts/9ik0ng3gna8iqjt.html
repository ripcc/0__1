      <p>still dont get why does wkone seems to favor uncl so much. he is literally the
reason why we could never get a proper dorm content like any other normal groups
bc that man refused to live together with the rest and somehow wkone was just ok
with that? not to mention how he got his solo flopping yt show as soon as the
group got formed and even after the scandal broke, they still busted their ass
to promote him like what exactly is uncldongies screaming mistreatment for?
literally never seen wkone moved as quick as when they did to defend him for
cussing at a fan</p>
