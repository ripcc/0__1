      <p>Their voices blended well but he rearrangement of the song could've been better
ðŸ˜­ I guess they made him do the lower harmony in the chorus so her voice can
stand out and some adlibs were quiet like they both sing so well idk why they
made it like that, I really liked his solo parts tho his lower register is so
tea Im so used to the insane high pitched and falsettos in jbwon music</p>
