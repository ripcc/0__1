      <p>Everyoneâ€™s so negative ðŸ˜­. I was gagged I was so happy with the fancon set list,
I was jumping for joy when I heard placebo, literally all I ever wanted! The
performances were done so well I think this was a million times better than the
aug fancon. I literally had no complaints the whole thing was amazing, I think
it would be cool if they switch up songs for the days so we can see them do a
wider range of their discography but no complaints this fancon had my blood
running blue - Chanel</p>
