      <p>diff anon but this reminded me of zhao lusi didnt she have some nerve paralysis
or something due to overwork and insane dieting? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ If shes one of the bigger
actresses and they do this to her imagine mid/ low tier actors/ actresses OOF



c-drama is &#x27;popular&#x27; but u also gotta keep in mind china got like 1 billion+ ppl
and millions living outside of china so ofc they be watching it but doesnt mean
its good &gt;.&lt; just saying like thats not a good indication for popularity imo Idk
but I always see crosins telling jao to not come back to c-ent and i think that
alone says a lot cuz they know their own industry best.</p>
