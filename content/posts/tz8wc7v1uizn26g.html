      <p>i&#x27;m ngl seeing jb1 with fans does nothing to me because they&#x27;re not gonna date
someone just because their boobs are out during a fancall like I BELIEVE OUR
JEBES ARE MORE CLASSY THAN THAT! (aside from maybe mttw LMAO) but dating rumors
with other idols got me feeling sick because that&#x27;s way more plausible imo
ughhhh ðŸ˜’</p>
