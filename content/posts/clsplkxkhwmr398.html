anon not the one that said you would know everything on the cside. but yeah lmao
it&#x27;s still pretty common knowledge from what i&#x27;ve seen that his contract ends
soon and he was never gonna be in the yhz group anyways that was planned before
he even joined the company where have y&#x27;all been brother</p>

      <p>I feel like what yall think is common knowledge is very different from the
average 0s. Like Iâ€™m not joining group chats or interactions with crosins. I
havenâ€™t even seen the letters thing discussed anywhere besides here and a couple
other places that also censor themselves so this is interesting to hear</p>
