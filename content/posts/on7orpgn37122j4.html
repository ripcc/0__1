      <p>yeah i can see him replacing hbn as mnets son if he debuts guy‚Äôs cute, soft
spoken and probably speak better english and japanese than hbn (deduced from a
few secs clip üëÄ), plays piano, not as good as hbn in dancing but he can dance,
got a good voice too and he‚Äôs so much TALLER than hbn feels bad for hbn as an
alln but errr it‚Äôs life ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

      <p>i guess they have a similar image but all those aren&#x27;t really qualities to
replace hbn. i feel like they would replace him with whoever the most popular
ktrainee is or someone with a da3hwi type personality. and what does height have
to do with it üò≠ i looked it up and 1.5 inches is not much taller</p>

      <p><p>its just a troll comparison jgfihgfjd but no i think theyre set on this trainee to replace hbn hes the most similar out of the popular ktrainees but i think theyll change course on who they rlly want the center to be its between sngwon or sanghyn</p></p>
