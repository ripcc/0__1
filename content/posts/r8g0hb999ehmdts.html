      <p>oooh let an evol rant for a minute this has been pmo so bad... like obviously
they dgaf about being referred to using she/her since thats p common in the gay
community for queer men (plus in their native languages gendered pronouns aren&#x27;t
really a thing so why would they care about english pronouns that much) and
somehow that has turned into western fans literally telling people they identify
as non binary? like the members themselves said that what they mean by
&#x27;genderless&#x27; is dressing outside of the traditional gender norms and styles,
it&#x27;s nothing to do with how they themselves identify? god forbid a gay man
presents more feminine lest everyone just assign them as genderqueer when they
themselves have never said anything like that</p>

      <p><p>no cuz thats what i thought too the point of their genderless concept was to break status quo not become representatives of smth else i get that fans would find comfort in them theyre the first group to do this but lmao with how neuro intl kpop twt is i expected this much </p></p>

      <p>Their fans keep saying omg I asked Wumut1 and Ru1 if I can call them she/her and
they said yes, that means they&#x27;re genderfluid and nb and we can use they/she
pronouns for them 😍 Girl they did not say all of that! Like did you think they
were going to say ew dont call me a she? ofc they said yes 😭 and Ru1 isn&#x27;t
fluent in English he probably didn&#x27;t 100% get what that girl meant. but even
then, this whole thing about &quot;omg all of them are enbies&quot; is so weird to me</p>
