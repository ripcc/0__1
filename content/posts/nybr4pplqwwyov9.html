      <p>maybe it&#x27;s just me but i dont really care about c popularity that much?? i mean
yeah if you want to have a career in that industry or you want big sales to
boast i would care but if my bias is korean and have a career in k-industry i
only care about the domestic recognition. but still i appreciate cfans that
support my bias tho</p>

      <p>imo having c popularity is a testament of being popular in korea bc usually the
only idols who are popular here are the ones who are already popular in korea.
only longstanding and big 4 idols have that privilege even da8 and j*n from sv.t
who are cidols had to earn c-ent for years and ofc h*be</p>

      <p>SM gave so much importance to Chinese market during 2nd-3rd gen. Their idol
groups that don&#x27;t have Chinese members have members who are fluent in Chinese
like DBSK and SNSD. SM&#x27;s peak was EXO. YG artists are just too talented to be
ignored by Chinese fans. Hybe is still trying to enter and I think, only Enhypen
has some relevance there now. I don&#x27;t think they like BTS there. But nowadays,
only the top idols in Korea have bigger fandoms in China</p>

      <p>Zbwon is the only new gen group with an actual hold on the c-market at the
moment (bc of zh) but everyone wants some of that pie thatâ€™s why bp 2 is split.
Even hybe debuted a chinese member but that was under pledis and they manage
chinese idols the best imo. i see SM trying to gain chinese fans back for riice
and wish by sending them to china and making them eat haidilao but nothing
compared to 3rd gen and i think they hate they way SM treats their chinese idols
too</p>
