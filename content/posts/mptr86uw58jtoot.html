      <p>i think itâ€™s gone because there was a bit of a misinfo basically they didnâ€™t
make a new scent it was released back in 2024 and i guess the name sounded like
0se so they went with it theyâ€™re just doing a collab with him rn to promote it
in korea ig but regardless itâ€™s still good for him</p>

      <p>his perfume stuff is a bit confusing , there are four products. three of them
were already released last year, but yesterday they released them again in
collab with him which includes a customised box and bottle cap with his
signature. this campaign will last 2 months, and i think they will restock every
time these products sell out because these products have sold out multiple times
in online and offline stores .and another one is supposed to go online on his
bday, then we will find out whether this one is made based on him or not or a
complete new product</p>

      <p>Basically for 1 of the perfumes they did a special signed version that they only
released 100 of 50 were sold online and 50 in store. Big joke because they were
gone instantly. But the rest are his picks of scents, the ones he promoted in
the shoot and they are collabing with him on those for 2 months ig. Thatâ€™s why
they have his face in their online shop and big displays with his face on their
instore sites too. The scent ros hasnâ€™t been released yet even though his shoot
with them has come out, they are releasing that in Korea for his birthday on
June 13th.</p>
