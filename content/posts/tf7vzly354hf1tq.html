      <p>Do you think there will be nwjeanz members who will come back to ad0r last
minute just like how that one fftyffty member did? Cause getting banned is
serious &amp; we might only hear from them at j@ejoong&#x27;s age</p>

      <p><p>I don&apos;t think any of the members would get decent treatment if they broke off and went back they sealed their fates being so public about everything. Also I heard the keena girl came back because she was the only member that wasn&apos;t from a rich family and she genuinely couldn&apos;t afford to be in that much debt</p></p>

      <p>Am I the only one who don&#x27;t think Ad0r is gonna lock them in the basement?
Because everyone is expecting that and it&#x27;ll confirm Ad0r always wanted them
replaced story so now they have an excuse to lock them up. But I feel like Ad0r
wants to prove haters &#x27;wrong&#x27; hence why I think Ad0r might promote them, with
decent quality too because everyone is expecting them to do the bare minimum.</p>

      <p><p>Well if they were gonna do that they could&apos;ve played coy and apologized and made some new terms with nwjns but.. they&apos;re making sure they get trashed in court ðŸ˜­</p></p>

      <p>i feel that way too but i think the court thing is more of a &#x27;it aint us its
them&#x27; if they really wanna bring it to court we have no choice but to kinda
thing. ew ðŸ˜­ i sound like a company stan trust me im not im just trying to say
adoor is giving ur typical shady step mom and nj is their step child they dont
like but pretends to like to prove she loves them just as much as her own
children and will let them act on on their tantrums (nj going to court, not
following court orders, going on social media after court etc) yet still buying
them the best clothes and lit lunches to impress other moms iykwim ðŸ˜­</p>
