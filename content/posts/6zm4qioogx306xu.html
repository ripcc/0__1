      <p>realistically speaking how could we complain to wakeone about the lack of group
content or lives ? if k fans were smart they’d be sending trucks already but ig
they dgaf about this like us int fans do idk…?



spamming the members on pluschat seems to be the only option😭 if we mass
emailed wakeone about it would that even work???</p>

      <p><p>😫... kfans have been complaining since debut and they have sent a truck before but look where we are 🤦‍♀️ its a lot to do with the fandom turnover rate as well, newer fans are gonna be less outspoken but it just feels very tired and wkn is hardheaded AF</p><p></p><p>and emails 🚬.. I had a good laugh.. that&apos;s been the monkeyrose go-to since DAY 1 they dont give a fuckkkkkkkkkk </p></p>

      <p>Not to make u guys emo but it&#x27;s also our last year so if anything there&#x27;d be
more solo push 😭🔫 The only ot9 we got is zbtv and concerts and comebacks and
1n2d since they love ot9 but that&#x27;s really it 💔 It&#x27;s all gonna be solo or unit
stuff</p>

      <p><p>imma have to disagree because weve seen what big solo pushes look like and the difference now is that theres nothing PERIOD. its looking slow in every department.. if they decided to just drop everything and focus on solo scheds (and by some miracle it isnt 3 ppl hogging everything) it would be better than living in an anti content world 😒 it feels like wkn just doesnt care to do anything at all since its their last yr. we used to predict it would turn into solo slop near the end in 2023 so i kinda expect it but this is worse jgfkdgfjkdj. im lowkey going on a tangent now but unit scheds arent the worst thing group stuff will always be better but id take that right ab now 🤦‍♀️ but FEAR NOT SISSIES WE MIGHT BE SAVED SOON</p></p>
