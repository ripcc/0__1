      <p>Pretty sure people already speculated Worksop was already casted and they were
just promoting that for hype. I donâ€™t even know where people are getting Workdol
from because itâ€™s all public things and someone would have spotted him but no
oneâ€™s said anything seemingly even his ssngs who usually know the tea havenâ€™t
hinted at anything either making me think itâ€™s an internal thing.</p>

      <p>its the MC role, also no offense to enchae but she wasn&#x27;t funny at all in the ep
she guested on, it was at a cosmetics store and she was like &quot;ugh but i have no
interest in makeup idc about this&quot; like girl the whole point of the show is to
try out different jobs, shuhwa had to do a filthy garbage house cleanup do u
think she had interest in that ðŸ˜­ enmix haew0n is the MC rn and she&#x27;s insanely
entertaining so when the mc recruitment went up ppl on instiz were like damn
good luck to whoever is next bc they won&#x27;t measure up to her</p>
