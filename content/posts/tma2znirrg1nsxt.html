      <p>oh a lot of them are mad trust me jdjdjt ðŸ˜­ they&#x27;re either avoiding the lukyz
stage like the plague or rting one post and calling it a day and saying why
didn&#x27;t zgh get a solo stage girl you dgaf you wouldn&#x27;t be saying that if it was
a jaobin stage lol besides most of them call duos of jao/janbin with other
members pushed and fake sooooo it&#x27;s not a shocker</p>

      <p><p>They&apos;re free to dislike it like nobody needs to be pocket watching their reactions ðŸ˜­ like are u rlly surprised the JAOBIN fans would want a JAOBIN stage. my whole point this time was that ppl can be upset zgh didn&apos;t get a solo or didn&apos;t perform kick it but that&apos;s it no need for conspiracies tweaking in my face or trying to shit on the rest of the fancon </p></p>
