      <p><p>boy do i have a story for you.. wow this is why icb theres new zeroses hfjghfjdk like how did you not witness this history but ill try to keep it short</p><ol><li><p>gwk is extremely capable, talented, and charismatic so an akgae is more likely to hate than token stan someone like this (allns used to love them some gyv and yjn back in the day ðŸ˜‚) and he has the similar qualities to hbn dancer, singer, mc</p></li><li><p>back in the day gpds werent this slow and dumb so ofc there was some pushback to them hating</p></li><li><p>fights spiraled and i definitely made it 100x worse since i ran a cc that was fairly active (not nearly as big as it is today) AND BOYYYY WE USED TO HAVE A TIME HATING ON HBN EVERYDAY </p></li><li><p>this made things worse and i was public still so i would shade tweet to death anytime there was a fight it used to be 20 v 1 ghfjghfjdkjfgh. so they just hated him even more and targeted him a lot when he would talk ab his aspirations and love for mcing </p></li><li><p>peak hate was feb 2024 when gwk and yjn special mced for emca but it kinda died down after that this is nothing compared to how it used to be these tards used to wakeup every day and tweet 40 gwk hate tweets hfdjdkjghfjdk ig they still harbor some of that BUT WE DONT CARE ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘‹ </p></li></ol></p>

      <p>all1ns used to love gv and yj? i thought they still did, or at least gv. they
still have cringe ass 2b1nz as their token zbwon duo it's YUCK.. but i guess now
that there's myungj4e, k4rina (lmao barely) and j33min (also barely), those duos
took over since one thing about akgaes, they love acting like everyone outside
of the group is their idol's 'true' best friend while the members are evil. a
squirrel could be in the background of a vlog and akgaes would wax poetic about
how it cares for their idol more than anyone else and go "thank you for loving
uri [idol name] ðŸ¥¹ðŸ’–"</p>
