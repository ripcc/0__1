      <p><p>ill try to summarize cuz im not sure but jyn got exposed by upset shippers/akgaes for having a gf and being with her all the time + smoking other fans started exposing sngyn and hynj for drinking and sleeping w young girls thats wy theyre calling them diddy lol and then other members smoking and then swoo talking ab disbandment to other ppl. i didnt scrape this as hard as i usually do cuz ive been rlly busy and lifes hectic rn but the thing with dbis is that they hide all this and expose it when theyre upset and as a former stan i can say its true tvz have an icky vibe to them lol</p></p>
