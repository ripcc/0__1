      <p>I appreciate this concern coming from someone genuine because there are certain
freaks who treat him like that, but there&#x27;s just something so sinister about the
same people who make tape jokes and sexualize jaobin in every single way try to
act concerned about their interactions being sexualized with other people like
it&#x27;s so painfully obvious what they&#x27;re really mad about but they&#x27;re disgusing it
as &quot;concern&quot; and it just gives me so much ick idk</p>
