      <p>Tbh it seems fair when you realise most of hb and gv space is just their clothes
rails. Like gv has the least space it seems even though his actual room might be
bigger and hbs room is mainly hust his clothes, his personal things aren’t
really taking up any space at all. Zgh has a built in closet so his clothes are
all out on display which may make his room looks smaller but if that closet
wasn’t there it would look bigger but just have shit on a rail</p>
