      <p>diff anon but i noticed something happening a few of times - some members would
say something like &quot;ohh i wanted to book a slot yesterday but by the time i
remembered all the slots were taken&quot; or &quot;other members took the slots yesterday
before i could reserve in the gc&quot; and the yesterday in question would have just
one live (usually gyv). i&#x27;m seriously starting to think this whole live
reservation thing is a psyop</p>
