      <p>I was curious about it too so I found a bunch of korean lvckyz stans and all of
them are freaks tbh... a lot of their tweets refer to jao as &quot;the teacher&quot; and
yj as &quot;the highschooler&quot; and they talk about their age difference etc Im hoping
most of them are yj&#x27;s age as that would make it less fucked up but its still
fucked, even more if its pedo noona fans who are into this shit</p>
