      <p>noyb is delusional and a pathological liar lmaoooo the only hot search that&#x27;s
been bought was for the kick it stage but if she&#x27;s talking about zgh she&#x27;s crazy
because with or without hot searches he&#x27;s ten times more relevant there, also rk
has been falling off like crazy on cside and has been losing fans mainly because
of his inactivity some riice and wish members have more sign-ins than him
nowadays</p>

      <p>She almost got rik dragged again on wb because of the us albums ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ She
purposely excluded jaos albums that were more expensive than riks (cause
resellers) to make it seem like riks were the most expensive. Resellers aside,
her purposely excluding a member like that, esp jao &amp; r0sins their #1 enemy
she&#x27;s literally setting rik up when everyone can check the legitimacy themselves
is the reason rik gets dragged on cside because she be blatantly lying all the
time to make stats in favor of rik ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
