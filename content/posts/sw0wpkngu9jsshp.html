      <p><p>krn fans dont let shit go its been popular since the dawn of time theres no appeal personally but its mostly to do with both gwk and tr fans chose eo and they fit basic kshipping criteria. the scarcity gets these girls more excited for some reason like KEEP UR TRASH kitty the loudest gpd tgv fan i see finally started posting mttwk i was kinda shocked but itll never be dethroned </p></p>
