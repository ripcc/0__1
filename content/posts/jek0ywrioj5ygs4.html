      <p>resident reddit lurker here i saw there was an unpopular opinions thread on the
subreddit so i clicked to see what zrs were talking about and lots of ppl were
saying mt is too cringe with the fan service and rizz stuff like woah chill….
like at least mt provides other shit with his talents and nice personality, we
have the real enemy who is jw who gives nothing but then i remembered reddit is
wngdngie hive so nvm, like i was even tempted to comment some shit but #nah it’s
not worth it. one thing that interested me is someone saying mt and tr probably
aren’t as close as they seem (ehhhh idk if i agree, they’ve never come across as
‘soulmates’ but like they’re still close) but what really got me was them saying
tr sometimes looks annoyed at mt like aroo? 👀 have you noticed that or anything
like that bc i got flashbacks to gyubrae beef and how that was so obvious but
maybe there’s more i’m missing</p>

      <p>new thing is how they say stuff like mtty does not care about him e.g how he
left for Canada during that situation but then turn around and say he is the
only one initiating interactions and jiwoong does not care at all for him like
for example in this last video how he asked to eat together pick a narrative</p>
