      <p>Tbh at a certain point 0 just gotta accept that’s how they are running😭 I feel
like this gets bought up every couple of months and it’s lowkey a tired convo
like there are so many update account that will talk about all members just
unfollow them 😭</p>

      <p>Hot take but am I the only one who actually doesn’t care. Like if they were
pretending to be ot9 then I’d get the outrage more or if they were selectively
like that to one member I’d get it. While I do find it weird they are pretty
openly a solo so like I just don’t follow them and idk why fans act shocked or
outraged when it’s nothing new at all. Like if I’m honest there are so many
other hbn fan account that post all his moments with the members just follow
them instead if you wanna see them 😭.’</p>

      <p><p>it&apos;s rlly a regular Tuesday ass post for them but these ppl r just new fans and you know how zrose twt works. its just normal to expect even a solo content acc to post members so they&apos;ll be up in arms every time </p></p>

      <p>I don't too because i blocked and muted a long time ago (they have a weird hate
boner against zh specifically it's so obvious) but that doesn't mean they
shouldn't be called out anon because a lot of zrs don't want to interact with
akgae accounts without knowing, it's ridiculous how allns were laughing and
calling her a "queen" for being a proud solo and not giving a fuck about the
group until they saw the followers dropping and started deflecting as usual and
saying she isn't she's just a focus account and doesn't hate the members lol</p>

      <p><p>like it would be diff if she came across as pure solo but we can tell that&apos;s not it 😭 and yea ppl who don&apos;t know are gonna be up in arms. it&apos;s an old thing w this acc but it&apos;s not outrageous this happened</p></p>
