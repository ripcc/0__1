      <p>don&#x27;t get mad at me but nwish sawryyyy their concepts are kinda tea, the music
is decent, and subfandoms don&#x27;t fight each other as far as i can tell 🤫 don&#x27;t
get me wrong jbw are still the goats but these days every time i check twitter i
see zrse fighting and rk being lazy as fuck and my mood is ruined 😒 and it&#x27;s
not like i can move onto another jbw member because i&#x27;m just going to be
thinking about rk the entire time, i need an entirely new distraction from
everything going on</p>
