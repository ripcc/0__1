      <p>no kzeroses mad because it was supposed to show the managers MANAGING them being
kpop idols, like they shoulda showed them helping with practicing, rehearsing,
helping the members etc but they only showed them eating so now the kgp who
knows nothing about the jebis will just think they fat pigs who just eats.



the only &#x27;managing&#x27; part was when the manager with hair saw uncs being
uncomfortable with his eyes during the fansign and brought him something.</p>
