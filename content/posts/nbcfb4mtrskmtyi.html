      <p>yknow what i dont understand is that wk1 has dead set using health problem as
the excuse but why was that company acting like mentioning the missing members
would be controversial like all of this problem could have prevented if wk1 just
let the members act normal. from making the members apologize, to make like
mentioning those two is gonna be controversial, to agreed to do an interview
addressing the situation(setting them up basically), to upload that ot7 pic(+bad
choice of bgm). like just stupidity after stupidity. i know wk1 is dumb but
theres no way they didnt see the backlash coming right?ðŸ’€ its not like this is
the first time members missed a schedule bc of health condition but this time,
the company was being sooooo odd about it like if you wanna lie, at least make
it believable instead of making it more suspiciousðŸ’€ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>Ykw i actually did see some rsns speculate that the members might have been
being vague abt hrbz because if it gets obvious they arenâ€™t actually sick and
its a visa thing the organisers can sue for breach of contracts of wkones part
especially for loss of revenue with how much refunds they had to give. Sickness
that canâ€™t control but if they were being lazy with their visas thatâ€™s their
fault</p>
