      <p>Seborrheic dermatitis! ðŸ˜¢ Don't ignore this condition, as it might get severe.
Here's what worked for me

Use ketoconazole shampoo 2% with salicylic acid.

Avoid using oils, as they can make your scalp more oily and cause more dandruff.

For severe dandruff, consider beclomethasone dipropionate lotion 0.05% (around
â‚¬4-5). Apply it overnight and wash it off in morning



please consult your doctor before trying any treatments.
