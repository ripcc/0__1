      <p>yeah i already realized it but honestly most of the sane people left the fandom
and just moved on to other groups or quit kpop in general, its just sad..
especially cause intl. zrs twitter is just a world war rn, its just constant
akgae vs zrs/jaobinist fighting and idk but it just ain&#x27;t fun to witnessüò≠</p>
