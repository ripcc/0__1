      <p>r0sons are acting like zh made durian popular and made it sales go up to 1
million ðŸ’€ if he was a member of beetees i would say sure but please wake up
yall... zh is popular in korea (kpop fans not even gp) but not to the point of
changing or making a durian trend</p>

      <p>durian wasnt a thing in kr before he started promoting it tho. if you search
durian in krtwt they mostly talking about jao. esp the inkigayo? pre-rec durian
event, it made all over the krtwt. his soobshow ep is always the most watched ep
and it trended on yt kr so idk about the sales but theres one thing for sure, it
is a fact that jao made durian popular in kr. no korean celeb or any kpop idol
is linked with durian in korea the way he is</p>

      <p>Korea started getting into Exotic fruits ever since the year started. Jao may
have had korean kpop fans talking about it since he kept on promoting it during
a very good time (where the fruit was gaining popularity alongside other fruits)
but anybody outside of that bubble knew the fruit as just the fruit. The ajumma
next door wouldnt have bought it because some guy from a kpop group loves eating
it and went on some kpop show to talk about it.</p>
