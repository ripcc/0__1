      <p>Knets in on it too üò≠ Tbh my perspective on him changed after the riyangi opp
appeared like idt he&#x27;s lazy anymore but rather he has boundaries when its work
vs not work but can be seen as lazy since pchat is money therefore work. i dm&#x27;d
them when she appeared cus I wanted to understand rk more and she said something
about for someone like rk it can be mentally exhausting to be constantly being
perceived so when he can he wants to be private as much as possible just to keep
it healthy if he wants to stay in this line of work and something about having
strict work and private life boundaries even though it sucks for fans, she said
he did try to communicate more after rukidans called him out but he still went
back to his old ways so he probably figured out whats best for him and as real
fans they should respect that so i think hes hardworking but strict with work vs
priv but yeah sucks to be a fan if ur the type who constantly needs content
