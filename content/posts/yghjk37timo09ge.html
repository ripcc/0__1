      <p>i feel like the other dorms are mostly just bedrooms and maybe a small ass 1
meter kitchen where they cant cook shit and rk and matts dorm is the common
gathering dorm wiht rk and matts bedrooms where everyone goes to cook and chill
in the living room because rk live streamed on that blue couch before and matt
did a live on the massager chair in the living room and the weights obvs belong
to rk and matt</p>
