      <p>they&#x27;re doing a listening party on spotify tomorrow and the day after which the
members are gonna be there for apparently? but it&#x27;s only for certain regions so
idk how many people will be able to access it and since it&#x27;s over two days it&#x27;ll
probably be half of them one day and then the others the next day..... that&#x27;s
the most we&#x27;re getting i fear</p>
