      <p>Random thought but do you think big companies outside of h*be would be willing
to take members of the group after disbandment. I was just seeing about smnbg
and apparently one of their known trainees is an ex to1 member so it seems they
arenâ€™t on that strict private thing with their trainees anymore</p>
