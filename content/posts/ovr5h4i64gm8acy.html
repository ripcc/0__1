      <p>cream soda and the one with them being astronauts (i don&#x27;t even remember the
name of the song) are not bad but... they are soooo mid when we compare to their
old songs, can&#x27;t believe songs like power and lotto used to be hated at the time
bc not being as good as their other songs but now we have to glaze them bc their
recent ones are mid ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>tbf theyâ€™ve had a total of two cbs (obsession + cream soda) since enlistment era
so pretty much all of their music is old music. dftf was a fan song too so that
doesnâ€™t really count. imo their best album is exâ€™act but they still have some of
the best bsides in kpop. not many groups even have one song as good as gravity,
let alone like twenty others the way xo does (ie white noise, let me in, one and
only, what if, oasis, playboy, what is love etcâ€¦). essem musical excellency died
with lsm and yyj leaving. thereâ€™s a reason aeâ€™s last good album was my world.
the lsm fraudulence gave the music flavor and he had a vision that he sold his
soul to the devil for. like who would be insane enough now to create a group
like ntc and give them and xo insane concepts and lore.</p>
