      <p>Nah they&#x27;re just debating rn what to do for &quot;rights protection&quot; which could be
anything from a mass email to trucks. Calling for rights protection or whatever
happens all the time whenever a cfandom feels their idol is snubbed. If they do
end up doing trucks I&#x27;m ngl you can just ignore them since they probably won&#x27;t
be posted on x and no company responds to trucks anyways</p>
