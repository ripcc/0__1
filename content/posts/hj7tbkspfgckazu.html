      <p>Gw has to be in the group if they decide to debut a boy group. That company has
pretty good connections within the industry. The same thing goes for Hb himself.
I can see in the long run that the group TheLive debuts will be more popular and
succesful than the Yuehua one. Anybody who trust Yuehua is a fool</p>

      <p>Forgetting anons weird ask I really do hope that if they have been keeping an
eye on him they really consider him for an upcoming bg. After a deep dive they
are really well connected not just the ones that are publicly known but rv was
really intentional in choosing what staff to hire in who would benefit a new
company because all the staff who work there have long experience in the
industry and are extremely well connected. Plus the one reason I think HB might
have it better than the others in terms of treatment / how much his company will
be willing to do in comparison to the others is the simple fact his company have
no idols. They don’t have a single idol / idol group under them rn and if they
want to start even they are well aware they need to do all they can to promote
and push an upcoming bg he’s in, I saw in comparison to the others because all
the other members (-jw who I can’t see staying in music) all come from companies
who already have groups, who already have idols out in the industry and have a
name. That’s another reason why I’d like him there, obviously we can’t know for
sure whether it would be better but it deffo can’t be worse than jellyshit and
I’d rather the risk of a group whose company need them do do well and will pour
a lot of resources into than a company known for having good artist but doing
nothing to support them because they are already established.</p>
