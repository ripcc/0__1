      <p>I want the cmag deal with hb to happen just to see how much it sells. Sorry but
I live for the drama ðŸ¤­ Cmuls had an aneurism when rk outsold yj&#x27;s cmag, I kinda
want to see their reaction if hb somehow overperforms too.</p>

      <p>i would say his selling power is quite good for someone whose main fanbase is
korean, unlike c-celebrities where everyone competes for who is the best seller
i don&#x27;t think korean companies show any selling list. it is just my assumption
from fansign slot things, his fanbase is not as big as yj or ricky but his
fansign slot is pricier than them so i think he would sell almost around as much
as yj</p>
