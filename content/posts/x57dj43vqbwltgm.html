      <p>ngl I always had a feeling them jp girlies got a choke hold on them ever since
they went on that lil bro trip to japan last feb ðŸ¤§ðŸ’”



i rmb i said gyu was the type to be in a bunch of situationships because hes so
friendly and likes to flirt but crosses the line where the girl thinks theyre
dating and he doesnt and goes &#x27;o wait, were dating?&#x27; typa thing and then he
dates them for reals because he feels bad and a ppl pleaser</p>
