      <p>aside from the general lack of dates complaints they also probably can&#x27;t sell
out kspo again cause its on chuseok they&#x27;re not attending aaa cause of their
taiwan concert and aaa is literally also in taiwan this year???? no way they&#x27;re
actually attending but if theyre making them miss then probably less ppl will go
to the tour cause ppl will wanna attend an award show with many artists over
their tour and then the venues they booked for malaysia is also very small MY
GOD CAN THIS GROUP JUST DISBAND ALREADY</p>
