witty jao&#x27;s korean has improved like crazy ðŸ˜­his pronunciation also improved he
still sounds like a foreigner but his vocabulary, usage of words and how he
quickly picks up on any context is so impressive that&#x27;s some real dedication you
really don&#x27;t see that many foreign idols being this serious about their korean
fluency ig that&#x27;s why kfans like him</p>
