he just be saying anything sometimes like wdym you don't do fanservice that's
literally your job as an idol? ðŸ˜­ maybe he meant well and couldn't express
himself properly but this kind of talk just blurs all kinds of boundaries that
should be set between fans (gf stans/shippers etc) and the idol, like at the end
of the day doing fanservice doesn't mean your love for your fans isn't genuine??</p>

      <p><p>I get both sides because ppl use the term fanservice as a way to say there&apos;s no real meaning behind idols actions so he thinking oh no that&apos;s not me!!!! But everything an idol does is fanservice whether it&apos;s genuine or not and he&apos;s funny CUZ BOY U BE UP THERE LYING PLEASE ðŸ˜‚... he&apos;s not the brightest and loves to encourage schizophrenia so I think he meant it he&apos;s just not realizing it&apos;s an actual boundary that&apos;s needed and it can still be genuine YOU ARE SERVICING US THANK YOU</p></p>
