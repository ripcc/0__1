      <p>Sometimes I feel bad about not succeeding as much as some idols but then I
remember so many are middle school drop outs who might be attractive but they
went through so much painful plastic surgery and are underweight and likely lack
energy and cannot date out in public, and for female idols, likely lack periods
and negatively harm their fertility. It really is a question of how much you’re
willing to trade for the fame. Sometimes I think randomly of M@rk Lee and how
his mom said she felt bad because he never got to go to prom or live life like a
normal kid, and yk what, I’m kinda glad I did. But whenever a big controversy
comes out I remember how uneducated some of them are. 7/8 of the He@rts2He@rts
members apparently dropped out of middle school for idol life. That’s just
insane to me. And the thing about plastic surgery and filler - that stuff needs
maintenance too. Some are only a one-time thing but like some need to be redone
or touched up multiple times in your life, like boob jobs are only good for 10
years and then you need them replaced or they could leak toxic fluid. My friend
had a mom who had cancer symptoms and the doctors thought she had cancer before
discovering it was matter leaking from her old implants. Jaw shaves also tend to
age badly as you get older and filler could always migrate to the wrong places.
Also idc what anyone says, those artistic schools like Hanlim, even if someone
gets their diploma from there, I doubt has the curriculum as rigorous as normal
schools. So the odds are if you’re pursuing a college degree you’re likely more
educated than your faves unless they’re one of the rare ones to go to higher
education, like how EX0 Xu!min has a whole PhD.</p>
