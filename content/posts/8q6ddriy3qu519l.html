      <p>The J.K. Make Tokyo Great Again hat is insane to me because like, itâ€™s even
worse than KKKarina because of the history with Japan. How are you gonna kill
two birds with one stone and stand with fascist populism and forsake your
intricate countryâ€™s history of colonialism in support of the colonizing power?
Insane. Donâ€™t even get me started on the misogynistic implications too relating
to the indifference towards comfort women. These idols dumber than a bag of
rocks. Youâ€™d think heâ€™d be extra careful considering he just got out of serving
and during his service was the military declaration scandal. It was on purpose -
thereâ€™s no other way to interpret it. BteeS has always been meh to me but J.K.
was the best out of them. Do I gotta give that title to fuckass J!n now ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I think the alternative makes it even worse.. like let&#x27;s say in the 0.00001%
chance he didn&#x27;t have malicious intent/didn&#x27;t notice or read it but like is he
so dumb and ignorant and careless that he can&#x27;t be bothered to read 4 words on a
cap he was wearing around in public</p>
