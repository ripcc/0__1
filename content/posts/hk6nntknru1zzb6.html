      <p>honestly looking at the rumors of what his potential role is, i&#x27;d actually say
its a pretty good fit for him (a younger taiwanese man who is bf with one of the
main female leads) especially since when he speaks mandarin, it&#x27;s similar to the
tw dialect. it&#x27;s interesting to see a news exclusive about it now (not sure how
normal it is) cause it looks like the drama is supposed to come out in sept but
i also can imagine its to drum up excitement....lowk i hope he gets to actually
sing on the ost cause that would make sense (similar to the xtx sb yj cameo)

      <p>was it because of political tensions tho because the festival said they got all
legal permits a mainland china actor was in taiwan like a week ago a3spa was
also in taiwan iirc recently so i don’t think it was so much political as prob
wk1 rlly did just mess up their visas</p>

      <p>nah it makes sense since it happened only to the chinese ones. the document
thing or whatever is that to issue the visa is more complicated for chinese
citizenship</p>

      <p>the organizer mentioned abt performance permit as a whole group, i guess another
process was needed for the individual visa or sumn and wk1 staff were busy
tagging along jao to italy recently so i guess they forgot to recheck things or
whatever</p>
