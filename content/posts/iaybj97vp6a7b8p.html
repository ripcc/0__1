      <p>this is killing me literally who gaf about tweets graphics or instiz trendsðŸ˜­ it
can be because the same fans keep spamming the tweets and all. those fans should
have invested in his upcoming chn magazine more if they really want to brag
about something that is actually tangible no shade</p>

      <p>But keeping track of the number of tweets for a hashtag during some event is
pretty normal though. Even big fanbases like blinks, stays, armys do this
because number of tweets does equate how much they were talked about and stuff.
Also, idk if it were like 1-2k more tweets than others, id say it could count
spam but almost twice, thrice the others canâ€™t be due to spamming. But yeah this
is pretty common for people to post number of tweets for a hashtag during
events, itâ€™s pretty valuable actually.</p>
