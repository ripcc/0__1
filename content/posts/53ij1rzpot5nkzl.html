      <p>were ads/views bought for yujin&#x27;s cover bc i just got to it now and saw it&#x27;s
already at over 120k views which is a lil crazy since i feel like zb1 videos
don&#x27;t do numbers like that. when i saw it hours ago it had 110k views so i feel
like if the views were more organic, then they&#x27;d be a lot higher by now if
they&#x27;d already gotten over 100k views in such a short amount of time? but then
the video has 26k likes which doesn&#x27;t seem too bad, idk how often ppl actually
like youtube videos</p>

      <p><p>zb1 videos can do numbers like that the fans just purposely neglect their main stream of content: badly edited and filmed inconsistent zepisodes ðŸ˜’... maybe they bought some ads but its his bday cover and hes fairly popular 120k views doesnt seem that crazy but their videos usually cap at this number anyways</p></p>

      <p>you will see if these were bought (which they were) if you see a big drop for
daily views suddenly for example you can see a BIG drop for jwâ€™s last cover
after they hit one million, it was doing like 30 or 40k daily and then suddenly
2 or 3k daily</p>

      <p><p>I can believe it&apos;s bought but couldn&apos;t that also just be the rate of interest? I doubt most ppl are rewatching and this isn&apos;t going outside the fandom but idrc ab this to really deep it </p></p>

      <p>no it canâ€™t because here are other giveaways along with that and that is how a
video that has not gone viral is doing better in terms of views on its third or
fourth day instead of the first two for example also you have another example of
a yujin cover and that was his dancing rm when he had more fans too and those
views are no where near what he has on this cover</p>
