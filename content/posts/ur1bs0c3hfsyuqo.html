      <p>his face fluctuates a lot but i think its the hair that makes it or breaks it
tbh like he looks the best whenever its not sitting like a flat bowl mess on his
head and is actually styled and has volume but overall he has a nice face he
reminds me of sowhee and i get why u dont like taeraes looks that much cause
sowhee is so handsome to me too</p>
