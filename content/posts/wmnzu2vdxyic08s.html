      <p>Its kinda funny how Zer0ses try to talk themselves into thinking that the boys
have no control over their Pchts. They forgot that G7u and GW0ok congratulated
H4nb1n on his Bday and started blaming Wkaone for not letting them post anything
about H4anb1ns Bday ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ These people cannot be helped and at this point Im
sure that they dont want help</p>

      <p>Tbh most of it was jaobin shippers begging for a jaobin selca and then pinning
it down to a ban like plz be serious if gw can post a duo pic and which happy
birthday and gv can outdo his janbin lovefest on that day then they definitely
could post if they wanted to ðŸ˜­ like just accept they didnâ€™t post and itâ€™s ok
not everything has to be documented and posted like sure itâ€™s nice if they do
but itâ€™s not the norm I guess for groups to post birthday things</p>
