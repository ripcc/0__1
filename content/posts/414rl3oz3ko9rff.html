      <p>maybe ricky will pick acting after zb1 heâ€™s the type to get into whatever he
wants and would pursue it, ive seen recent fancalls and its like the third time
in heâ€™s mentioned wanting to do it ðŸ˜­ like he seems really enthusiastic ab it he
said he wanted to do a villain role well good fpr him he can do the villain guy
that doesnâ€™t gets the girl id want that ngl ðŸ˜­ im actually looking forward
