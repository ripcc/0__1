      <p>Not about the new guy replacing him but I rlly though hbs mca contract would be
up soon but like anon said they went all out for his birthday posting so many
vids of him and putting loads of custom stickers over his dressing room mirror
with one saying smth like stay with mca forever ? Yeah I think he will be there
at least till the group disbands</p>

      <p>I think it&#x27;ll end when the final tour starts. Idt he&#x27;ll have enough time to do
both things. They&#x27;ll all be overworked as hell in their final months.</p>
