      <p>the way n4n4 is continuing to go in on s*nwoo is so funny to me.... i haven&#x27;t
actually seen the video so i could be wrong but my opinion on the actual
situation from it i lowkey don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s that deep (i guess it depends on
how rude he comes off bc it could either be not that bad or really bad) BUT he&#x27;s
always given me bad vibes and has had other controversies so i like that she&#x27;s
whacking him a bit LMAO apparently she said she doesn&#x27;t even know him so it&#x27;s
not even like he was rude to her personally. also i saw a p*nnchoa post and for
his birthday - which i think was today or yesterday - he did some self made
music video and had his female friend act as his love interest in it and then
say that rather than say it&#x27;s an actress... he&#x27;s gotta be stupid like the
scandal happening during his birthday can&#x27;t be helped but the timing of
specifically saying that is üíÄ</p>
