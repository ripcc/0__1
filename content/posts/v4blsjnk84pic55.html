      <p><p>theres no kpop show on this planet thats not following some kinda guideline ðŸ˜­.. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS UNFILTERED CONTENT but besides them putting certain members tgthr in situations its still natural theyre not on there reading out lines and refilming scenes </p></p>

      <p>choosing those 4 members is intentional too tbh it&#x27;s clear them picking up yj
(not to say they wouldn&#x27;t normally but yk) and going to haidilao is a script too
of course the interactions aren&#x27;t scripted but there&#x27;s a plot the show writers
pushed for sure</p>
