      <p>do you think the tariffs and trvmpo&#x27;s insane policies could affect the
theoretical US tour? he just said he&#x27;ll place a 100% tariff on movies that
aren&#x27;t produced in america so who&#x27;s to say he won&#x27;t go crazy and place tariffs
on int artists&#x27; tours and concerts? american singers don&#x27;t tour in SK that much
compared to the amount of SK artists who tour or have kpop festivals in america,
so idk, trvmpo could totally accuse SK of scamming america or some other bs for
all we know...</p>
