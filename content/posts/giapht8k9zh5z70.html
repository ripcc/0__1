      <p>He was a lil freaky frog today and I’m here for it, lowk I really enjoy when
both of them act carefree around eachother like this like they both got schizo
akgaes that in some way do affect how they act around each other on cam and in
certain situations so I like things like this. Nearly had a heart attach when
zgh mention hb on pc not even for shipping but just because anyone who pays
attention to those two and knows the state of their sfs knows how crazy / rare
that is. I wonder if the closer they get to end of contract they are getting
more comfortable/ free with eo like this might be the last year they work
together anyway might aswell make the most of it and not let others ruin it
especially when they are as close as they are</p>
