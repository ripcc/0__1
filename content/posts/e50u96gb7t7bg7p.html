      <p>i dont think he knows that you need to play with the cat toys with the cat ðŸ˜­
g1a has sooooo much energy bc he's a kitten, so he should be playing with him a
lot but you can see that g1a bites him a lot and is easily overstimulated so
he's definitely not getting enough attention... the kitten phase is the worst
even tho they're really cute at that phase but they just have so much energy and
you have to spend a lot of time with them and based on every vid I've seen of
the cat he's definitely not playing enough with the cat/// being a first time
cat owner is hard but i hope he reads up on it to make the poor kitten's life
easier
