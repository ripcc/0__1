      <p>putting aside irrational tweakings aside I think the biggest problem with kick
it is that it&#x27;s just not meant to be performed with 2 ppl.. with one person it&#x27;s
like fine it doesn&#x27;t matter it&#x27;s a solo 4+ ppl it&#x27;s like yasss this is the vibe
but with TWO PEOPLE IT JUST LOOKED FUNNY like jao hitting his high note and and
yjn going all out doing the dance break part alone HE LOOKED CRAY CRAY SKDKSKKDS
I BURST OUT LAUGHING</p>
