      <p>istg anons are way too dramatic lmao that dude ships bin and jao with multiple
people including members from other groups like the neos and xtx, but he doesn&#x27;t
believe jaobin are fucking all the guys he ships them with. I think this drama
is another case of shippers thinking shipping = believing the people you ship
are dating or fucking irl. not everyone believes the people they ship are
actually dating lol like I used to be a b/ts, 5sos, and 1d multishipper but I
never believed any of my ships were real... shipping doesn&#x27;t always have to be
taken seriously, people! 😔</p>

      <p>Jaobinists can&#x27;t have an opinion of their own and need EVERYONE to agree with
them, like think what you think abt them why get bothered by other&#x27;s opinions or
preferences

( and I&#x27;m saying this is a jaobinist)</p>
