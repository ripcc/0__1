      <p>it won’t let me quote any asks 🤦‍♀️ but as someone who ulted xtx before getting
into jbw, sbn used to do the absolute most when it came to bg 😭 like he would
constantly call him pretty unprovoked, always brought up how bg’s his fav
member, etc. like he was always doing too much mfndskdj literally at one point
people were saying that sbn clearly likes bg more than bg likes sbn. it wasn’t
until he started getting mad shit from k-m*as for showing too much favoritism
toward bg that he started mentioning him less and less. he even started
censoring himself whenever he spoke about bg (like he would say “a member and i
went out” instead of just saying “bg and i went out”) and im pretty sure bg even
said that sbn always takes care of him / is affectionate off camera but doesnt
like doing so on camera bc he doesnt want it to come off as disingenuous. sbn
still has his moments obvi but this is why nowadays we see sooo much more from
bg, making it look very one-sided.



as for the nature of their friendship, bc they were roommates at debut and are
currently floormates they’ve naturally always been close. their chemi name is
danjjakz (which is commonly translated as bestfriendz but honestly the meaning
holds so much more weight and significance funnily enough this tweet explaining
the meaning came up on my tl earlier) and that in it of it self explains the
kind of friendship they have. so with them it’s more so a “best friends that
ended up falling for each other over time” type of thing so on a surface level a
lot of their interactions appear very platonic rather than romantic so i’m not
surprised anons were saying they have no romantic chemi lol



this is getting so long i’m so sorry but they literally do everything together.
after schedules they eat together even tho they always end up fighting over what
to eat (they’ve even said they’ve gotten sick of each other’s fav food atp),
they would stay up until 3am on the phone with each other, during sbn’s hiatus
they texted every single day even tho sbn’s notorious for being a bad texter,
etc.



they also went to vietnam together and although sbn hatessss planning stuff he
planned out the entirety of the trip and even carried around a sign that had a
picture of cilantro crossed out to show at restaurants bc bg dislikes eating
cilantro



but yes ofc u can chalk this all up to them simply just being very close maybe
even codependent bffs but idk it’s hard to explain i feel like it’s difficult to
fully grasp the nature of their relationship if u don’t keep up with them.



Honestly tho regardless of whether they are actually romantically involved the
yaoi-ness of their height difference, bffs to lovers potential, and absolute
obsession with each other is enough for me 😍</p>
