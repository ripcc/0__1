      <p>If Anon is talking aboug this one... Most comments and even the title are just
aboug Durian and how much it smells. There are a few SB fans in the comments too
but thats about it.... More like a new Durian smells bad is this and that rather
than &quot;Let me actually stan this other guy who is with the Hybe Idol on here&quot;

      <p>Durian just seems to generate discourse on theqoo for some reason bc his
inkigayo reverse tribute also had a hot post there I think it&#x27;s in okay
territory as long as the comments aren&#x27;t direct hate on jao bc unfortunately
especially as a foreign idol sometimes you need shticks good or bad like this to
get your name out there. It could lead to him being known for something but imo
it&#x27;s better than not being known for anything</p>

      <p><p>its purely predictive now i hope he can shake it just cuz once things become part of ur image its impossible to move past esp w the discourse potential. but yea sometimes shticks work we just dont have great luck gghfhgfjekjgfkd</p></p>

      <p>I was hoping violin or being some musical genius would become his thing not a
fruit ðŸ˜• Like h3nry and how they always made him play the violin everywhere
which was nice since it got him casted as a regular for shows like begin again</p>
