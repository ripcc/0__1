      <p>someone dropped new tea about the old admins of jao&#x27;s cbar and damn they really
acted like his antis and sent him letters to manipulate and guilt trip him.



<a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5154052862380512">https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5154052862380512</a>



they sent him several letters between crush and ftp era blaming him for his own
mistreatment, making him worry about his lack of schedules, acting like his
managers and telling him to do xyz or else he&#x27;d lose fans, they even told him
about their fandom drama and that they, as a cbar, would no longer open group
orders for z/b1&#x27;s albums. girl, I&#x27;m reading the letter op posted and the old
admins literally sent him a copy of their statement about the boycott &quot;just in
case&quot; he hadn&#x27;t read it yet. like omffgggg they are fucked in the head. they
also asked him to give them info about the group&#x27;s schedules and cbs along with
any potential solo schedules he could have and used their position as cbar
admins as an excuse because they &quot;needed to know&quot; the info in advance to &quot;guide&quot;
the fandom. thankfully he never replied to them. but that&#x27;s not all, they also
asked him about his lines in ftp (the album wasn&#x27;t out yet) and told him cr0sins
expected him to have the intro, chorus and ending parts since he was the center.
WHY WERE YOU DOING THIS TO HIM YOU FREAKS?? 😭😭 they also told him about
allegued job offers he got in china, they told him some brands, pds, and event
organizers approached them because they were interested in him but that he was
losing tons of opportunities because of wk/1 😭 the worst is that they used
their position as admins to tell him they spoke for all cr0sins / that every
cr0sin agreed with the content of the letters when in reality no one but a few
members of his cbar knew about the letters 😭😭😭 op disclosed only one letter
(the one that was sent during crush) because it was the least toxic and the
others were too manipulative and hurtful. ref, I don&#x27;t even fw jao like that but
I feel so baaaadd. idk if you remember but some members (I think it was gv, gw,
and tr or hb) said jao had a hard time from late 2023 to early 2024 which
matches with the timeline of the letters. if any r0sin is reading this pls
correct me if I&#x27;m wrong but wasn&#x27;t jao also constantly staying up till 3am
around that time (ppl could tell because his bubble showed he was still reading
messages at 3am, sometimes 4am) and wasn&#x27;t he also rambling about meditating,
controlling one&#x27;s fustration and stuff like &quot;I know love makes people anxious
but please trust me&quot;??



I&#x27;m glad those admins are gone but the damage is already done 😭😭 at least his
cbar has new admins now...</p>

      <p>It&#x27;s really heartbreaking because no one knew about it till now.. cr0sins are
asking for the head of that person responsible for these letters since no one is
coming forward to admit what they&#x27;ve done to him behind their backs or
apologize😭 it&#x27;s diabolical how they were pressuring and gaslighting him in the
name of &quot;all fans&quot;, but on a positive note he handled it in a very mature way
and he didn&#x27;t respond to their schizo demands nor let them control him which i
really admire especially as a rookie idol, people are saying those old managers
have never been into kpop and they&#x27;re basically just into chinese domestic
entertainment and they want him to go back to china after disbandment like they
really dgaf about him at all, also yes anon that was the period he&#x27;d stay up so
late reading messages from the fans he was basically being tortured and
manipulated by those freaks, thankfully he knows his cfans support him in
whatever he chooses to do now but it&#x27;s still fucked up how it&#x27;s only getting
exposed now</p>

      <p><p>😭 he gets bitched a lot but things as extreme as spreading conspiracies ab the other members I don&apos;t think would&apos;ve moved him. he would def get stressed and tweak out at claims of fans leaving him if he doesn&apos;t act right but dassit i feel like </p></p>

salon drip (because they don’t like ha0bin) he straight up called them out on
live</p>

      <p>yeah none of his fans posted a clip on twt cuz they knew he was calling out his
solo stans and they didn’t want to show that (they were all over the live chat).
if you watch the replay of his live it happens in the first 5 minutes. this is
the translation another ns posted of what he said except it doesn’t include what
he said at the beginning which was basically “everyone chill it’s a variety show
please view it in a fun way”

&gt; is jang doyeon ur ideal type? i once mentioned on &#x27;blossom with love&#x27; that 0se
&gt; was my ideal type. when attending salon drip i thought about how to express
&gt; the many things i watched as a kid and how it was an honor to be able to
&gt; participate in the program.”
&gt; 
&gt; “underwear was part of the show!”
&gt; 
&gt; “its not the one dimensional meaning that everyone thinks, theres layers to
&gt; it. so please dont dislike it too much, ok?</p>
