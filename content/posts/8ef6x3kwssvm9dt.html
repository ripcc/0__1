      <p>I know you maybe are not interested cause you dont stan them but I try to see
izn@ chart if they are flopping but honestly they are doing quite ok as a rookie
grl group and I can see c j &amp; wk one will push them even more. Their recent song
sign is climbing up melon daily and spotify kr chart. (The song did a bit better
than doctor doctor tho) and their daily spotify streams kinda consistent with
200k+ every day. If we say about flopping then I would say kepjer is facing it
cause their last song peak at around 800+ melon daily chart and thats probably
