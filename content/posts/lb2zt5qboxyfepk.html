      <p>Gw and Tr beefing fr is so funny. Probably one of the only times I’ve been
reminded that Gw is a 20 year old dude and that maybe he isn’t as mature as I
thought, still love him tho. Tr should be more flexible (speaking as someone who
is the same way as he is but realized my rigidity is not super welcoming)
meanwhile Gw shouldn’t be so headstrong either (also maybe don’t dog pile
someone too). Both need to grow a little, but I’m thankful to see when they act
a little immature. It feels genuine. I’m sure the solo stans are having a field
day but it’s just a small disagreement and they’ll resolve and grow closer from
it. People taking it seriously and like they killed each other’s mothers is
taking me outttt</p>

      <p>Not anon but first there was the door-shutting incident then recently while they
were in Shanghai there was an OT9 live Weibo where Tr kinda disagreed with the
rest about food payment (he likes dutch while the rest are like I&#x27;ll pay for
everyone this time you&#x27;ll pay another time) then I think wookie and yuj said he
stinkler and never buys food for them and bought for others and everyone
dogpiled on Tr after that</p>
