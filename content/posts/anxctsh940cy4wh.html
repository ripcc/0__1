      <p>So based on what i&#x27;m seeing, im assuming yj is dating either a jp/kr girl rn,
gwk is dating a chinese girlie, jw still with his gf(?), gyv also has a gf and
jaobin are obviously a thing.... so nothing for tr, mtw and rick againðŸ˜’ also
yes i&#x27;m nosy and bored rn... so just ignore my weird coke rant about the jebis
dating lolðŸ˜… ik tr likely doesn&#x27;t get caught dating bc hes unpopular and dates
nugus/normal girls, mtw same reason but how come rick never gets anything?ðŸ¤”
also that acc on tiktok is still going on with the fake janbin dating rumour,
it&#x27;s really kekkyðŸ˜‚ luckily no one dumb enough to believe it(surprising
considering we know how zrs are..)</p>
