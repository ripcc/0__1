      <p>i&#x27;m neutral on the njz situation but i lean more towards team njz. this recent
injunction has kinda made the public switch up on them ðŸ˜­ it&#x27;s sad that they
might be spending their 20s and what should be the very height of their careers
fighting in court hybe is never going to let this go either.</p>
