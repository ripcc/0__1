      <p>okay i know rky is part of the problem and doesn&#x27;t wanna hustle but lowkey its
getting weird how he&#x27;s hardly in official content, like if i was a casual fan i
wouldn&#x27;t even know he&#x27;s part of the group based on their social media. also when
he&#x27;s rarely ever interviewed individually in the zepisodes. i&#x27;m not even a rky
stan but ive been noticing how even the members mention him less and less and
it&#x27;s just weird, i wonder if smth is going on behind the scenes. he&#x27;s never
mentioned in the stories with the other members. damn i miss my ot9 family ðŸ¥²</p>

      <p><p>biggest and probably only factor is that there is no content.. basically this entire year has gone unpromoted and theyve always had issues with selfmade content the only indication this group has a heartbeat is when they do their own things which we know rky doesnt so its gonna be jarring. i like him a lot and it sucks that hes basically absent but idt anythings going on hbn just mentioned him in is vlog </p></p>
