      <p>oh it was cuz of the poca thing an anon sent in earlier and ig my crash out
about it didnt send through? how they say hes so funny for not using the props
properly for pocas but then cry about him not using props properly for their
photoshoots then the whole being &#x27;excluded/ erasure&#x27; cuz all the other members
had props but if u watch bts u clearly see him holding props but just not using
it üò≠ then saying &#x27;oh wow so the editors purposely chose the pics with props for
the other members but not the one when r1ck is holding a prop? see they hate
him&#x27; PLEASEE STFUUUUU</p>
