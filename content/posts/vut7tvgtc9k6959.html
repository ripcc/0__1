      <p>If "since zbone's debut their relationship hasn't been great" is true, idk how
that could've affected the group as a whole. Correct me if I'm wrong but yhz
didn't get that many schedules in 2023, iirc their stans were always tweaking
because yhz spent most of their time in the dungeon in between In Bloom and
Crush. The zbes also got individual and group ah+ covers in 2023, right? That
must've been a yh thing ðŸ¤” They did start doing stuff for jao, yj and rk like
the solo mags and the variety/fashion shows... ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” does anyone remember if any
of that messed group schedules up? Some of their staff were fishy tho, and then
there's the taiwan controversy. Some people think yh told rkjao to stay in
korea? Idk why they'd do that but if it's true, then yeah they fucked us over
big time with that. They also managed the merch distribution for the tour in
china iirc.</p>

      <p><p>okay so that is definitely history rewritten... YHZ IN DUNGEON ðŸ˜­???????? THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SUCH A THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for the most part all i rmbr from early zbwon is that yh did some staffing for them and it was evident they had their hands on stuff like schedules and collabing for products ngl it doesnt sound like a strained relationship at all quite the opposite </p></p>
