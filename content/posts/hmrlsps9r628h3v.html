      <p>So after weeks of snooping on Twitter Iâ€™m afraid to report I am a big fan of
Junse0. Heâ€™s can actually kiss and act (wayyy better than JW lol), sing, dance,
look good and have a personality. Plus heâ€™s buff and seems like heâ€™s pretty
sweet and down to earth. I like the fact heâ€™s born in 2001 because he feels and
acts grown and from some of the WE! variety I saw heâ€™s actually pretty confident
but not cocky and itâ€™s reminding me of baby Gunwk ðŸ¥¹. Yâ€™all should to get Junse0
pilled because Iâ€™m like 99.99% sure heâ€™s making it.</p>
