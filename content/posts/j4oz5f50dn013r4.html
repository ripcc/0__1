      <p>Fuck those managers but what do crsns have to do with it tho they didn&#x27;t know

      <p>Previous anon here i am not generalizing because trust me i was there, it was
allns skrs and wdgs the worst offenders and those tweets would get 2k-3k likes
so yea it was indeed thousands of people agreeing and that was when likes were
public who knows how bad it would&#x27;ve been if they werent, it was also at a time
where allns were obsessed with bringing anything from wb and blaming it on
crsins like their own kind wasn&#x27;t doing the same just because they get bullied
on there, they don&#x27;t do it that much nowadays bc fortunately zrses stopped
taking them seriously last year during gsb when kfans sent banners when the
group skipped a music show encore bc of mattbin&#x27;s variety show recording, allns
posted a random ass ss on twt in chinese from a crsn with 0 likes that was
talking about sending trucks to wk1 bc of zh&#x27;s having 0 kr schedules and they
said they&#x27;re the ones who sent the banners taking advantage of the fact most zrs
dont speak cn.. LMAO anyway a zrse clocked them and brought receipts from
kforums that it was indeed kfans (or antis) so yeah don&#x27;t tell me i&#x27;m
generalizing anon (sorry if it&#x27;s long)</p>
