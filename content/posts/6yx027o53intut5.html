      <p>i was gonna ask about what&#x27;s happening.. from what i&#x27;ve seen there&#x27;s jy
dating/smoking, him sy and hj having pretty young girls over at their dorm (i
think? it was like 04 and 06 what i saw) and then someone in a discord i&#x27;m in
sent some we1b0 link about jy offering a girl to take a molka of yh that he&#x27;d
send to her which didn&#x27;t reach the intl side apparently????? i keep seeing ppl
say disbandment but idk if they&#x27;re saying that bc of all the scandals or if
that&#x27;s ANOTHER rumour that&#x27;s being spread during all this (but lowkey teebeezee
go through it all the time so are we sure that this is fr gonna take them down).
is there anything else i&#x27;m missing?</p>

i don&#x27;t get why sw would spread the group is splitting up if they just signed
with a whole other company and had a cb tho ðŸ˜­ unless he said that to ppl before
all that stuff happened</p>
