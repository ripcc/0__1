      <p>i donâ€™t even get why zroses would want to watch bp2 like not even on some
jealousy/zbwon replacement shit wtf is appealing about this when weâ€™ve already
been through the ringer and itâ€™s awfulâ€¦.. and if itâ€™s just for the potential
drama, i said that about bp and now iâ€™m deep in zbwon ðŸ˜­ but hey if you want
another serving of wake1 (bc why would they not debut under them? and if not
them then probably some equally shitty cj sublabel) fuckery that doesnâ€™t focus
on the group and only on dumb individual schedules for a few members, no lives,
no variety, enslavement, depression etc etc then thatâ€™s cool ðŸ˜‚</p>
