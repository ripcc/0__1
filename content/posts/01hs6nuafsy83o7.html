      <p>Generally if cbar admins don&#x27;t quit themselves it&#x27;s very hard to oust them from
their positions ðŸ˜­ I know some people who have been pushing for them to be
removed since 2023, lots of cr*sins have criticized them since 2024, but it&#x27;s
not that easy to force them out especially when the admins refuse to leave.
Finally getting them kicked out this time took a lot of effort from a lot of
people, many from different factions of his fandom who don&#x27;t get along with each
other but all hate the admins. Also most cbar admins are assumed to be akgaes or
at the very least solos so unfortunately nobody will say much about them shading
other members, being shady happens across many different groups.</p>
