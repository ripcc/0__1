      <p>hmm idk the swf thing made me belive they'd stick him there for the bigger stuff

      <p><p>the markets are just so different tho swf is kinda falling off since its so biased but mnet are ab to pour way more into the svs show i feel like and that aside it just would go against law to have hbn mc theyll find a way to involve him but hes not gonna be the main guy. esp not when theyre touring at the same time</p></p>
