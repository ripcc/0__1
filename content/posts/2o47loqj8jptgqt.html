      <p>all of them lurk on xhs and weibo to get tea to drag the other one so it&#x27;s safe
to say they have selective vision for a lot of things</p>

      <p>isn&#x27;t that just like how every type of fan ignores what they dont like to
see/not interested in ðŸ˜­ like shippers who mute/ignore their interactions with
other members it really isn&#x27;t that hard tbh you just curate your own experience
while stanning and it&#x27;s for the better but akgaes have to take it a step further
from ignoring to being hateful lol</p>
