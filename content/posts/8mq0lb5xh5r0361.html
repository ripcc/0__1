      <p>I think something went on but I doubt a schedule since they were all supposed to
fly back together plus I doubt they’ve booked in anything for hb. When he’s been
mcing for 3 days and was loosing his voice by day 3</p>

      <p>Hb mentioned he had a different schedule and that he stayed and extra day to
rest and he’s filming smth. My guess is it’s probably the same thing my zh and
gw filmed a couple days ago.</p>
