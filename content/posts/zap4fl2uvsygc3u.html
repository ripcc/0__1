      <p>i don&#x27;t really have any desire to listen to their songs, at first i was
boycotting because people were leaving our boys just so that they can stan big4
groups later it just become disinterest. that&#x27;s why i still haven&#x27;t listen to
any pnd or siize song fully, only the tiktok portion but are their songs really
that good to chart like this

instead of directly buying views unlike z🌹s</p>
