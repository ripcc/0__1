      <p>I&#x27;ve been snooping around the starship svs and y0ungh0on and wonb1n really do
have some charisma. Even though the show is flop and besides those 2 everyone
else is boring, I feel like with the right marketing, they could be a pretty big
threat to the yh bg, especially since ive has everyone in a chokehold and
starship made kiki go viral too. I really hope yuehwa plays their cards right
next year. I also feel like they&#x27;ll do a brighter concept bc of y0ungh0on and
pre-debut crav1tea which is probably the opposite of the direction yh will go.
And han yoojin really needs to learn how to smile and be more expressive or else
this y0ungh0on guy is going to eat him up.</p>
