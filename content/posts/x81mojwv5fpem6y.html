      <p>I know you dont care about Jaobin but I feel like Hao is doing all of these
chinese jobs so he can later get out of Yuehua. Rosins are mad that most of his
gigs are money making gigs. It is like Yuehua is pushing for these gigs so they
can benefit from it before he leaves.</p>

      <p>anon duhua always does this with her cashcows and/or the artists she favors and
I suspect it&#x27;ll only get worse for zhao after d day. she hasn&#x27;t done that much
for him in terms of exposure since afaik he&#x27;s only been to one chinese variety
show but he&#x27;s filming another one rn and both Keep Running and Hello Saturday
are very popular shows, especially Hello Saturday since it airs on Hunan TV, the
second most watched tv channel in china after CCTV. so yeah she&#x27;s finally giving
zhao something really really good. I agree she won&#x27;t let him go that easily
especially if the rumors about wang yibo not renewing his contract in 2026 are
true... ðŸ˜¬ (2026 too... what a coincidence...) but look on the bright side anon,
if zhao becomes one of her favorites she&#x27;ll give him a lot of elite resources
that will give him exposure along with the usual money grabbing gigs.</p>
