literally every single group in the world does pobs and even more in number and
have to do fansigns till months later to fulfill the slots and they don&#x27;t sell
1M sales in the 1st day like bitch please hoe like yes I agree with some of the
things said but I hate when solos try to act &quot;civil&quot; and that they&#x27;re middle
ground and that they care about the group</p>
