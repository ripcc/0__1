      <p>i used to be neutral abt them but their fans set them up by constantly comparing
them to ggs like no a man will never outcunt the woman!! i saw one of their
retard fans say that cunt doesnt even mean pussy like girl😭😭😭😭😭and then
they call u transphobic bc theyre nonbinary and use any pronouns (sidenote are
nb identities as prevalent in sk as they are in the west? cause their language
isnt even gendered right)</p>
