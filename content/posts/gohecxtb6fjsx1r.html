      <p>Although if I were a cr*sin I would be calling the police right now....one of
the head admins (and the most notorious one) is in Japan right now and I
wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if she&#x27;s fled with her monies and the rest are all on
their way out. They shut down the r*sin shop also and everything&#x27;s stuck in
limbo and the r*sins are still trying to wrangle out details and ledgers.
They&#x27;re giving them too much time to pull their funds and flee the country. Once
they pull funds all that&#x27;s left is to nuke their accs and then it&#x27;s gonna be
difficult to get their monies back.</p>

      <p>Wait lol this reminded me of something a while ago when people were complaining
about them doing something fishy with money but Iâ€™m not sure of the whole story
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­yeah if they had access to all that money plus all the fundraising they
would have been doing for upcoming projects and his birthday and they dip thatâ€™s
not going to look good at all especially for a big bar like that</p>

      <p>Jaos Cbar orders big amounts for Jaos magazines and then ends up canceling them
(according to The17 cfans). I was oringaly not believing them but now that
everything about the old staff is getting exposed.... It does looks like those
things were true</p>

      <p>Oh yeah i talked about that before, the &quot;ordering magazines to a different
place&quot; or byh is a common practice that th*8&#x27;s bar is doing rn too for his mag
where fans only get back their magazine pcs and not the magazines themselves to
save space, we know cbar actually ordered them because fans ended up getting
their photocards. The stuff that cbar hasn&#x27;t sent out is from cbar-made goods
and unpacking album pcs that fans bought from them, the complaints about
shipping are from that and not magazines. I&#x27;d personally be calling the police
on them if they didn&#x27;t send us magazine stuff because I joined those byh orders
myself</p>
