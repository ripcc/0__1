      <p>diff anon but i heard about that th rumour since it was mentioned in alice&#x27;s ns,
someone was saying they knew several people who worked at h*be and this was like
a common rumour and no other b*s members had dating pasts involving men. also i
don&#x27;t wanna re-type it all so i&#x27;ll share the original post but i remember this
ask with a BUNCH of rumours from someone who apparently had a source working at
kbs which i found extremely interesting

      <p>as the person who sent the original ask with the link lemme make a guess.. i&#x27;ll
say bt*b and p*niel but i remember watching a podcast with him on (🤣) and he
went to high school in korea (not sure if his whole high school experience was
there) so it&#x27;d probably be middle school for him</p>
