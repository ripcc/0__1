      <p>being an individual trainee is beneficial for wkone by the way, they
automatically gets signed to them if they end up debuting (like j4ehw4n from
wnna1). nothing wrong with that, but it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if they push
likeable individual trainees since that&#x27;s what they wanted from bp in the first
place before they had to change their concept</p>

      <p>Not necessarily because I mean they might temporarily sign over for the duration
of the contract but they don’t have to sign as an artist with wk1. Take jw for
example like his management just does his acting stuff and nothing for his music
so if we ignore that he may aswell be an individual trainee and that’s how he’s
taking home the most$ because he’s not splitting it with an ent agency. If the
individual trainees don’t want to sign with wk1 outside the same contract the
trainees who have an agency do then they will keep 100% of the money they make
after wk1 and cj take their cut which is a much better deal.</p>
