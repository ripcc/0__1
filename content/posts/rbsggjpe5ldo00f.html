      <p>The thing is when zh joined yh he would have had a trainee contract not an
artist one and a trainee one is extremely different. Once he placed first and
joined zb1 he would have had to sign an artist contract with yh, to sort out
terms like payments and management ect which is why yh is able to be involved in
his management now because heâ€™s signed an artist contract with them. Considering
heâ€™s still with yh and not left we know he did sign an artist contract with them
when zb1 formed and j canâ€™t see any reality where yh would have a svs winner and
say yeah letâ€™s only give him a 2 1/2 year contract and he will never come back
to us. That makes no sense, if they made him sign an artist contract after bp id
assume he got the wyb special that locked him in With them</p>
