      <p>Wanna one also moved out from their dorms 6 months before disbandment so this is
not the first time this happened, moreover their lease will probably end this
june, since it&#x27;s an annual contract. And it&#x27;s also a known fact that once idols
show their dorms to public that means soon enough they will move out</p>

      <p>anon I was the one who cleared this up on neo they moved out a few months after
debut into new and better dorms. they extended their contract a month into 2019
for award shows and disbandment concerts but moved out officially at the end of
2018 which was confirmed by c-sasaengs at the time and even if they didnâ€™t leak
that info everyone knew because they were all depressed as hell on fancafe and
talked about missing their roommates when they would do lives in january. you
canâ€™t rewrite the ancient texts I was there!!
