      <p><p>They&apos;ve been getting whipped and tortured for 311 so they&apos;re def on good behavior now but all I can think of is the schan uriboo lore that led to people finding out that he and nst jwoo using to go to hunting clubs or smth idk if I believe that tbh. also apparently eseok brought his ex?/her friends? to their encore and put them in the family section and fans went mad </p></p>
