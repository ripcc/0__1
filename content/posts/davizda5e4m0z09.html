      <p><p>okay guys please I never said I believed anon CHJFJFN WE CAN STILL ENTERTAIN RUMORS!!!!! the cat agevestigating is just going nowhere. according to the rumor tho if they met/started dating in jan ehhh may isn&apos;t too crazy esp if he&apos;s expressed wanting one for himself pet gifting is only irresponsible if the point is to raise it like a couple child </p></p>
