      <p>i feel like ive heard he&#x27;s passed the written exams but didnt have time for the
practicals like months ago so it&#x27;s not a far stretch but i think some xhs
girlies were saying he was just waiting for manager? to come



on a separate note, im not surprised about him being serious about the kboo life
and living in kr full time; idk something about all these embeec gigs makes me
think yh might like still keep zh in kr knowing he does a pretty big fanbase
(maybe even to spite wk!/cjay) and just do similar to what yq does in g-idol.
even though its a different time/circumstances, it makes me wonder if ekso
didn&#x27;t implode in the way that they did with the c-line, specifically lh, what
kind of career could he have had in kr?</p>
