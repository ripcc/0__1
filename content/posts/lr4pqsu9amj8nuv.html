      <p>tartar fans love to flex about how tartar made to the lineup without a
screentime but if you watched bopeul, you&#x27;d notice that he&#x27;s always been pushed
as a main vocal since the audition. for back door, the main vocal was actually
ynseo (yes that evven guy) but he was the one who got highlighted as the group&#x27;s
vocalist and for that man in luv stage, he literally got the whole group&#x27;s
screentime for himself LOL if he wasnt highlighted as a main vocal during the
show, he wouldnt even make it pass the first two rounds sorry he&#x27;s short and got
a big head. visual-wise he&#x27;s a hard pass</p>

      <p>And ppl always forget that he was one of the 3 people whose ranks were revealed
before the final, like we all know ppl love to bring up them revealing hbn rank
3 but no one mentions how them revealing tartar’s rank essentially pushed him
into the lineup. They wanted phanb1n too but it didn’t work for them.</p>
