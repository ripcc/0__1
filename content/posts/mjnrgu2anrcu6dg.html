      <p>This schedule was filmed a while ago, during the time he was in China filming hi
Saturday.



Maybe he was just talking about recently gp hiatus activities? Or maybe to him
it&#x27;s a hiatus since they&#x27;re constantly filming behind the scenes on things we
don&#x27;t know until it&#x27;s released months later</p>
