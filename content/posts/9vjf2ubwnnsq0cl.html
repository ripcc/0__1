      <p>rik himself doesnt seem want to utilize his own popularity sjfhdjsjdjdj his
tiktoks and instagram posts usually got the most engagement out of the members
but he stopped posting non-promotional solo tiktok after that whole bite me
ordeal i think? which is a shame and i gen cant tell why he doesnt post on insta
often. if only rik could be more active, his popularity wouldnt just stuck among
the casuals but could also strenghten his core fandom (which has been weaken,
well, due to his inactivity and dont bullshit me with company ban because the
members themselves have expressed plenty of times that theyre free to film
tiktok themselves)



i started liking him when he said he loves journaling in his PR video and his
duality was what made me choose him as my onepick during boys planet but even
until he has lost interest in journaling, we literally never seen him doing
that. the company didnt want to promote him and he also didnt promote himself so
this whole situation is just upsetting tbh with all those &quot;what ifs&quot;.



i know he has this certain image he is trying to pursue but as a rookie, you
need to put effort yourself (outside of the company&#x27;s push) to raise your
popularity which something that rik doesnt seem to be interested to be doing:(
like if your company doesnt promote you shouldnt you be doing something to
promote yourself:( how unfortunate</p>
