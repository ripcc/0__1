      <p>i lurk in facts to fictionâ€™s dc (dancer who rates idol dancing) and she said zgh
is a better dancer than yjn, a few 0roses in there were surprised abt this but
yeah theyre both actually in the same tier w zgh being a little bit higher</p>

      <p>Ye I was replying to rqueefðŸ˜­ its ok to think yjn is better. Theyre quite
interchangeable, yjn outdances jao in choreos that require power projection and
athleticism. But he is limited to his specialty as he only had bg idol training
predebut. Jao took open classes in jazz funk predebut, not a useful genre for bg
choreo which is why he seems weaker than he is. But the experience gave him a
lil more well rounded technique so more versatility. He outdances in jebe1
choreos that arent power focused like yura ftp and gg dances. Fif said yjn can
improve if he takes more foundational classes to support his dance style, but
they prob have 0 free time rn to do that sadly. She made a ranking vid before,
its outdated but still v interesting (<a href="https://youtu.be/1_3TijeSKys">https://youtu.be/1_3TijeSKys</a>)

Also rqueef u can ignore this letter if u want the topic to end, just wanted to
clarify</p>
