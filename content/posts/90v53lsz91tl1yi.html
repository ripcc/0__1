      <p><p>AGREEEEEEE. jwg the only one with a full bed this is crazy gfidghrejkigjf but i was wondering why they only showed 2 living rooms i assumed there was 3 unless mttrk and somtaelz are somehow connected. i saw ppl speculating the opposite ab the living rooms the nicer one being zh2bn but ferkkk it could be the other way around </p></p>

      <p>I think the mttrk and somtaelz might be connected cuz back in crush era when
they were sharing rooms there was a mttgv live at the dorm and you could hear
jaobin in the background coming into the dorm and then later hb was heard again
looking for a hair dryer so my guess is now those units still share a living
room and kitchen and then jao2binz are on a different floor not connected</p>
