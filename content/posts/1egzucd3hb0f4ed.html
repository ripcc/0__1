      <p>jebew0n resting for an entire week (perhaps even more starting from tomorrow
since thereâ€™s no official schedules until the 25th???) thanks to the
prostitution event thatâ€™s happening on may 25, theyâ€™re making an entire monthâ€™s
worth of money bc of that! ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ least they could have done was
prepare some unit or duo lives for us since they are all free and not doing shit
but oh well</p>
