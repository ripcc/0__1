      <p>i&#x27;m ngl i genuinely thought they were gonna have w4nna 0ne fame LMAOOOOOOOO (i
was a kpop fan during their run but i wasn&#x27;t a w4nnable and i feel like they
stayed in their own bubble despite them being big in korea so i didn&#x27;t, and
still don&#x27;t, have the greatest concept of what exactly their popularity was
like). like i know people said to not really expect that but the way their
popularity during b0ys pl4net with all the public appearances at fan projects
was (and for eg when yhz celebrated 0llie&#x27;s birthday.. a day to remember) and
how it felt like they were the talk of the town about i was genuinely hopeful
that they&#x27;d be at least pretty well liked by the gp 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 that
quickly changed though</p>
