      <p>were ads/views bought for yujin&#x27;s cover bc i just got to it now and saw it&#x27;s
already at over 120k views which is a lil crazy since i feel like zb1 videos
don&#x27;t do numbers like that. when i saw it hours ago it had 110k views so i feel
like if the views were more organic, then they&#x27;d be a lot higher by now if
they&#x27;d already gotten over 100k views in such a short amount of time? but then
the video has 26k likes which doesn&#x27;t seem too bad, idk how often ppl actually
like youtube videos</p>

      <p><p>zb1 videos can do numbers like that the fans just purposely neglect their main stream of content: badly edited and filmed inconsistent zepisodes ðŸ˜’... maybe they bought some ads but its his bday cover and hes fairly popular 120k views doesnt seem that crazy but their videos usually cap at this number anyways</p></p>

      <p>you will see if these were bought (which they were) if you see a big drop for
daily views suddenly for example you can see a BIG drop for jwâ€™s last cover
after they hit one million, it was doing like 30 or 40k daily and then suddenly
2 or 3k daily</p>
