      <p>okay wait sorry anon who said the world tour would take two months here, i
greatly underestimated it bc i&#x27;m seeing tweets saying it can take six to eight
months????????? üëÄ that changes things.... unless they try cram it all in to
take like half the time</p>

      <p><p>ppl are overestimating the scale of the tour cuz last tour WAS a world tour ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.. and while it was dragged for ages it was from sep-dec idt this would be longer than 2 months tbhhhh and yea concerts are gonna extend their disbandment date but not by 6-8 months</p></p>

      <p>wanna1 did a world tour before disbandment from june to september, released last
album(full) in november, and did the final concert in january 2019 for 3 days
after their official disbandment in dec 31 2018 so it&#x27;s probably the same for
jb1. kr cb before the tour -&gt; world tour -&gt; last album -&gt; final concert or two
kr cb icl. last album -&gt; world tour -&gt; final concert. they&#x27;ll prob extend the
activities until jan-feb but def wont be longer than feb.</p>

      <p><p>my mutual posted this the jpn dates were before sea dates and 3 krn days before it started so I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if that happened. But I gen don&apos;t think there will be any other Asia dates the teaser only showed boxes on na eu and Australia üò≠? they should release the album before the tour not after cuz they wouldn&apos;t even have those 2 months that wannawon did but yea I think they&apos;ll disband around Feb not Jan </p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pjt-knowledge.appspot.com/o/content-attachments%2Fa3d162df-e164-4a01-9e40-45a820672839.jpg?alt=media"><p></p></p>

      <p>i doubt they&#x27;ll have the time to release another album after the world tour but
they might release a disbandment single like ioi&#x27;s downpour</p>
