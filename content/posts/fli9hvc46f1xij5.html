popular members among koreans they just like her sm idk why and now she&#x27;s gone
and the comeback seems floppy, explains jeemin push too had jiyoon been alright

      <p>There was a vote where the lowest ranked girls would go from island to ground
and lose the benefits. Jiyoon ended up having only one vote along with 2 others
and they went down. Think she expected a couple others like Jungeun to vote for
her as they were best friends but Jungeun didn&#x27;t. The 2 ended up having this
spat (or awkwardness) for most of the show which ended when Jiyoon apologized
for her behaviour. (Hb in the show even had them doing a heart together which
was max awks as they had just &quot;made up&quot; in the show)



I miss Jiyoonie :( she and Jungeun, are the best singers in Izna and are the
undisputed main vocals for a reason.</p>
