      <p>(Genuinely sorry for the length of this rant about ostensibly nothing, you&#x27;ve
been warned.)



Im not anti-shipping/anti-rps even if i take issue with them at times ik its
(mostly) self-contained and harmless plus we&#x27;re all delusional and unethical at
times so who am i to judge LOL. but ngl for any rps ship once it gets popular
enough or their interactions become enthusiastic and frequent enough (government
ship status=permission to be batshit), the line between shipping and tin-hatting
blurs among shippers and suddenly the sustenance of the ship &gt;&gt;&gt; everything
else, including the identities and potential/real feelings of the individuals
being shipped outside the context of the ship.



and i specify that last part because i think being a little dramatic on the tl
or crashing out about a potential change in their public dynamic, even if a
shallow/indulgent reading of a situation and incomprehensible to non-shippers,
is markedly different than some of the stuff i&#x27;ve seen insidiously assumed of
gw&#x27;s actual personhood for uhhhhh bantering with a fan? favoring gf stans for a
few repos after a million times favoring mthw/shippers? being accused of hurting
mthw and feeding gf delusions, as if the inverse isnt feeding shipper delusions
lol? and suddenly his actions are insincere bc he MIGHT have a new limit or, you
know, enjoy entertaining two opposing audiences? (its hard to describe to people
not engaged in this but something like &quot;doubting sincerity&quot; can be said in a
matter-of-fact 4th-wall-breaking way or a rageful delusion-charged way and they
are NOT coming from the same place.)



and i get that it might have felt &quot;&quot;ooc&quot;&quot; but frankly gmg is now unprecedently
mainstream and occasionally viral which means more scrutiny, projection, and
entitlement from the most vocal gf stans and shippers, two sides of the same
coin (plus a lot of people are BOTH, the divide is overemphasized for
organizational and political reasons), which can accelerate change. and that&#x27;s
not even accounting for just general judgement which is honestly a fair reason
to want to cut down on what they initially volunteered. and the chance of
consequences to their true off-cam dynamic and maybe professional lives also
rises (and yeah this applies to both gay AND straight ships, enough with that
whataboutism, there&#x27;s nothing inherently brave or progressive about gay
shipping), which i imagine can kill the fun of it. if anything gmg fans have
been extremely spoiled bc gmg themselves like being crazy and thus they have
developed an expectation for constant and escalating fanservice that cant be as
mutually amusing for gmg overtime.



anyway this &quot;shift&quot; (which i feel funny saying bc it hasnt actually been long
enough to say has happened üòÇ) seems to have shocked shippers who tend to hang
in their little cliques and collectively burrow into their fantasies, but until
hype dies down gmg are no longer &quot;performing&quot; for a private in-group of
hyper-perceptive fans (they arguably never were but ik feeling like you&#x27;re &quot;in
on a secret&quot; or &quot;a part of the team&quot; is the parasocial appeal of rps). that
should be obvious but ime rps fandoms skew young and slow-brained and interpret
things very literally which is unfortunate since engaging with rps in a
respectful AND still fun way requires more mindfulness than non-rps.



now while i dont doubt the controlling gf stans said some slick shit as always,
the hoopla of gw &quot;conceding&quot; to them is so overblown as of now and entirely
filtered through the shipper lens bc it was always clear that he was being at
least light-hearted if not outright joking? heres one video showing his
expression/tone, but it wasnt even needed imo:



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/sweety_bluerose/status/1910909567309152646?t=O2qg9JfmHWX9sU9mxDfTWg&amp;s=19"></a></blockquote>



so yeah nothing really new was learned but i just cant help but be bothered by
how the mere threat of potentially receiving less on-cam reactions resulted in
covert but genuine rage directed at the &quot;threatening&quot; party, and ofc it&#x27;ll be
minimally acknowledged and become absorbed into the endless shipper vs gf stan
war, probably for the better but also #illneverforget. And we been knew this
ship is mthw-centric, the amount of pitiful emotions projected onto a fantasy
version of him and the lowkey condescending white-knighting over this is just
more evidence, but hey at least his &quot;feelings&quot; are considered at all.</p>
