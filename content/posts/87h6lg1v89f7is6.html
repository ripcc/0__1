      <p>r0sons are acting like zh made durian popular and made it sales go up to 1
million ðŸ’€ if he was a member of beetees i would say sure but please wake up
yall... zh is popular in korea (kpop fans not even gp) but not to the point of
changing or making a durian trend</p>

      <p>durian wasnt a thing in kr before he started promoting it tho. if you search
durian in krtwt they mostly talking about jao. esp the inkigayo? pre-rec durian
event, it made all over the krtwt. his soobshow ep is always the most watched ep
and it trended on yt kr so idk about the sales but theres one thing for sure, it
is a fact that jao made durian popular in kr. no korean celeb or any kpop idol
is linked with durian in korea the way he is</p>
