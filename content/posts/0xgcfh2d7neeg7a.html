      <p>a lot of old chinese people (not chinese-americans) actually like trump more
because they think he only cares about business and money and wouldn&#x27;t want to
spend money on a war with china, meanwhile they find that democrats are more
war-mongering (obama and iraq, afghanistan, etc)</p>

      <p><p>ugh i hate this sentiment during the election so many ppl harped on the fact that trumps a &quot;business man that hates giving the military extra budget&quot; when he constantly expresses his want for war its just not the right climate ghfjdfhgfdj it wouldnt have mattered if there was a republican in office during the 2010s the wars still wouldve happened it all started during the bush presidency anyways. but im surprised they think that way i dont think a war would ensue simply over the fact that it would turn nuclear not cuz trumps cheap</p></p>
