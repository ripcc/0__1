      <p>I don’t even think they will extend till feb for extra shows like people gotta
remember what kind of greedy bastard companies they come from. Plus I assume
evn’s contract will run out at the same time so they can put the yhz and wk1z
together so they won’t extend any more than a couple weeks imo. The longest we
might get is mid to late Jan.</p>
