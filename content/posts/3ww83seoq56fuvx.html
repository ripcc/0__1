      <p>International presence does NOTHING for a group in the long run. Just look at
all the Bp reject groups. The only ones who are doing somewhat alright are VVNE
and they have the biggest kr fandom (and their fandom has more Kr fans than Intl
ones) out of them all. The others where the fandom consisted more of Intl fans
have flopped and are struggling to pay rent. By the way I dont consider Cfans
and Jfans as Intl fans. They are their own category</p>
