      <p>the new bp2 ktrainee center is apprently a chop and knetz are ragging on him
heâ€™s also an indv trainee but allegedly secretly in wki so heâ€™s gonna debut and
when he does youâ€™re probably gonna see levels of favoritism never been seen
before</p>

      <p>the guy is so boring, i get they were trying to go with a shb center route
(someone with non-divisive visuals and empty past) but.... the guy doesnt have
the charm at all. like they should have just gave it to some talented uggo who
at least looks like theyre having fun, kinda like deyhwi y00jung h1karu</p>

      <p>No I think that anon was just referring to the og anon saying hb had an empty
past, scandal wise yes. But also this makes me so curious since weâ€™ve only even
known him since bp and he did introduce himself on bp as a whacker and did that
whole whacking battle with lip j and then harut0 said his battle with hb was
very cunty to put it bluntly like vogueing dipping the lot, it makes me think
his og company had no issue with him showing that side of himself since he
wasnâ€™t hiding it on bp (but the dance battle got cut) I wonder when he goes back
will he tap back into that style, idt he will as much as he did pre debut but
like it would be nice to see him sorta tap back into it</p>
