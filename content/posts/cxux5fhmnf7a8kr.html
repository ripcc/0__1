      <p>Its funny how both a11ins and r0s1ns latch onto anybody outside of the boys
interacting with hb or zh. Its funnier when it comes to zh cuz most times he
will have one interaction, his fans will run with it and you will not hear about
him being friends with tht person unless the camera is involved ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I really
thought him and s00b became besties after that s00b show but they didnt even
look at eo direction at the award show</p>
