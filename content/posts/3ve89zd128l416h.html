      <p>I knew that both jao and janbin do way too much with the yaoi fanservice so I&#x27;m
not even checking on it anymore but tell me why I saw a fansite repo where jao
literally said him and janbin can&#x27;t kiss in public bc it&#x27;d be too dangerous like
what are you talking about this is crazy üò≠</p>

      <p>hb is a lot more reserved tbh i think he had a little more fun with it in the
beginning like in this post-it. with zh though there‚Äôs shipper fans he‚Äôs more
comfortable with since they‚Äôve done so many fansigns so he says crazier stuff
for them. just two weeks ago a different fan asked him about kissing hb and he
made an annoyed face lol so i think it depends on his mood too
