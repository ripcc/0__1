      <p>For fancalls they should give a person 3 fancalls MAX then donezo like
parasocial relationship is actually so dangerous I forgot if it was theb0yz or
enhyp3n but some chick on xhs almost commited cus she gen thought she was in a
relationship with one of the members and couldn&#x27;t stand it when they&#x27;d flirt
with other fans and said they were cheating ðŸ’€ I mean if you think about it fans
who pay for multiple fancalls are already a bit mentally ill ðŸ˜­ so now they&#x27;re
feeding into it even more like i agree just end that shit ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>oooooo trust me anon you do not want to see that.... sometimes at the end of
fansign events girlgroups would post group pictures with the crowd and they&#x27;re
all so fat and ugly ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ okay fine sorry if your ugly its not your fault
but at least try to be presentable.... cuz their hair is messy, shirts are
wrinkly and have neck beards and sometimes they&#x27;re so fat their rolls are
leaking out of their shirts ðŸ¤® and sadly from the few rare bf stans videos I&#x27;ve
seen girl idols do engage with the roleplay..... idk about fancalls though cuz
yeah they gate keep tf out of it but I would imagine them being the same
probably even worst since they don&#x27;t have to leave their house ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®</p>
