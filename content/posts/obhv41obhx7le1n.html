      <p>why are they still in denial im crying... like matt has done lives from their
dorm before and the couch was clearly very different from the one in this pic??
also looking at dcgall it seems like they already knew bc he always comes to fs
and the company/other events in a separate car while the others that dorm
together come tgt</p>

      <p>I knew that was a lie the moment they avoided the question and answered how
members switches rooms all the time. Let&#x27;s be real, if you&#x27;re staying at a form
and living there, why would you switch dorm rooms/beds all the time? It&#x27;s such a
hassle and people would prefer their own place and bed. They would want their
own personal items so they have a sense of normalcy and routine each day.
Switching rooms all the time sounds as if they&#x27;re at a hotel when to 8 if he
stays at dorms with them, it&#x27;ll feel like a hotel to him since he&#x27;s unfamiliar
with the place



I can&#x27;t believe there were people believing that lie ðŸ™„</p>
