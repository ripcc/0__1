      <p>okay i dont remb if it was mentioned here or maybe it was moon&#x27;s mond but
curious about ppl&#x27;s take on zh getting multiple m6c-related activities last year
to this year (special dy6 stage, special mc, travel/food narration, special
actor appearances, i wanna know being played in mbc shows), being called &quot;m6c&#x27;s
son&quot; in news articles (which honestly is just marketing but interesting to see
just how many different gigs hes had with this network)...like hb was obv always
&quot;mn3t&#x27;s son&quot; but wondering how much of it is yh/wk! influence or what kinda
connections he has with pds/staff cause it seems like there are folks who def
really like him. he is popular w/o a doubt in kr so this could be wk! actually
finally accepting kr love calls for him but it&#x27;s interesting to see what sorts
of channels/offers are accepted for members. nevertheless im happy that while
hes been unfairly targeted/bashed because of his nationality, his chinese
identity is also helping him to secure some fun opportunities for him.</p>
