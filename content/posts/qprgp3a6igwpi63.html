      <p>Icl this is why we never get group or unit shit cuz people still complain. Like
if it was the group anniversary I think I’d get people being mad but idt ive
ever had an ult to a live for their fandom’s birthday before and it seemed like
this was pretty spontaneous since they didn’t even have enough chairs.

      <p>tbh i think people are right in complaining for this one like some are blaming
the company (stupid) some are blaming the members who came on live but the blame
lowkey lies with the members who weren't in the live lmao there's no way it was
about some fucking ban or whatever they just didn't want to these fucking bums</p>

      <p><p>blaming the company under the guise that they stopped a group live from happening is stupid but blaming the company for letting a spontaneous unit live go for an anniv is chill they shouldve beat the others with rocks but this is wkn.. when have they ever cared.. SO MOSTLY ON THE BASTARD BAND STILL </p></p>
