      <p>gnr is popular simply because they match well and it&#x27;s obvious that they respect
each other a lot, they were awkward at the start but have been getting closer
consistently and take care of each other well, they know each others strengths,
love complimenting each other and match well in all areas including vocals,
gaming and more it&#x27;s that easy they&#x27;re not a trash duo just because you dislike
tr for no reason lol</p>
