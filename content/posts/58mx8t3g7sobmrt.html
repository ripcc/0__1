      <p>Ok I donâ€™t think exactly like anon but I do wonder if they are prolonging the
gap between their next cb as much as possible because itâ€™s a full album and will
be their last. Like in their head if they release it too early they will spend
the rest of the year with nothing new. I fear in wk1s mind they may actually do
aug/sept so we have full on promotions that go straight into the tour and then
award season.</p>
