      <p><p>they let all the bp jfs go.. and the fact that they&apos;d agree to manage a placeholder group means they clearly have nothing going on.. they haven&apos;t opened auditions.. like what&apos;re we even doing here.. all the ppl ik thatve stanned evn have said it seems like jf might even go under idk it&apos;s not looking good but gwk visits often SOMEONE NEEDS TO BEAT HIM IN THE HEAD IDC</p></p>
