      <p>They have different regional ambassadors so people are predicting he’s going to
be the ambassador for China and it makes sense since it was leaked on xhs and
these kinda leaks always come through the c side when the info has been passed
through his cbar. If it was a kside deal we’d know nothing about it.</p>
