      <p><p>theres def a mix of opinions around here that&apos;s how it always is but it&apos;s def more towards they&apos;re dating and that&apos;s my opinion too. I just don&apos;t have any interest in the ship so I dont post much ab it and I&apos;m not gonna answer why jfnfndnmdndmmd you could prob search &quot;jaobin&quot; on my ns and find smth but its just tiring discussing the same thing for almost 2 yrs</p></p>
