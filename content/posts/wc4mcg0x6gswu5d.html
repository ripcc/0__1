      <p>Didn&#x27;t want to scroll all the way back to find that anon who mentioned the
pregnant woman who got doxxed by wony&#x27;s fans writing hate comments but for more
context the comment she wrote that got her doxxed was on a fan post saying that
wony would be tired because of her flying during fashion week schedule, she
commented something like flying not being tiring for celebrities because they
sit in first class which imo is really tame. I don&#x27;t know if the separate weibo
screenshots floating around of the pregnant woman hating on wony and being vile
are real or not but they&#x27;re dated after she got doxxed so if they&#x27;re true she
probably lashed out after being terrorized by fans. Just a really unfortunate
situation for her and for wony but the fans deserve all the criticism they&#x27;re
getting</p>
