      <p>I appreciate this concern coming from someone genuine because there are certain
freaks who treat him like that, but there&#x27;s just something so sinister about the
same people who make tape jokes and sexualize jaobin in every single way try to
act concerned about their interactions being sexualized with other people like
it&#x27;s so painfully obvious what they&#x27;re really mad about but they&#x27;re disgusing it
as &quot;concern&quot; and it just gives me so much ick idk</p>

      <p><p>hmmm u can participate in smth and still acknowledge when things get weird this is less ab blatant sexualization its ship politics and zghs treatment like if one part of the ship is treated like food its gonna irk anyone who doesnt do it. ur right shippers do sexualize but nobodys surprised by that if youve never been into a ship these kinds of thing will always be bizarre lol. like tbh this is a regular tuesday cuz its nothing new WE MOVE ‚úåÔ∏è</p></p>

about bnb porn and unhinged stuff try to make a woke essay about how shipping zh
with another idol is morally wronghbfd? i just can never take this bunch
seriously just say ur mad it isn&#x27;t hb and move on they&#x27;re starting to sound
