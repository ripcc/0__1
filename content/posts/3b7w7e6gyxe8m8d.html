      <p>maybe ricky will pick acting after zb1 he’s the type to get into whatever he
wants and would pursue it, ive seen recent fancalls and its like the third time
in he’s mentioned wanting to do it 😭 like he seems really enthusiastic ab it he
said he wanted to do a villain role well good fpr him he can do the villain guy
that doesn’t gets the girl id want that ngl 😭 im actually looking forward
hopeeee yuehua gets him into those acting jobs, i see winwin and jun doing
pretty well maybe he can get some of that 😭 damn im so in it ill even watch his

      <p>nah he got shat on bad they kept saying his head is big, bad body proportions,
looks evil, green card traitor, looks like he&#x27;s raised by triads because of his
piercings and tattoos, leech (this is from crosins), looks like he belongs in a
peking opera because of his thick makeup etc... these comments weren&#x27;t even from
rosin akgaes or c kpop akgaes it was from the general public who watched running
man and their first impression of him. his response on douyin was good on the
other hand but that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re more young and know about kpop but
everywhere else was pretty bad. cent is just evil and will work him dry, gonna
make him weigh 80lbs because all male actors are sickly stick thin and will
control him wayyy more than wk1 for whatever image they want to push on him and
don&#x27;t get me started on the political stance bullshit that will make him lose
all his kfans and even ifans.</p>
