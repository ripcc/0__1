      <p>I think it‚Äôs because jaobin are never paired up in official content so more than
copium I‚Äôd describe it as ‚Äúresentment‚Äù towards other ships that the company
pushes.. but it‚Äôs not m*ttbin‚Äôs fault if w*1 refuses to capitalize on jaobin
(those would be the easiest money they could make tho)</p>

      <p>But Anan chose the duos, not w*1. They chose jaobin last year, does that mean
w*1 wanted to push jaobin back then if we follow anon&#x27;s logic?</p>
