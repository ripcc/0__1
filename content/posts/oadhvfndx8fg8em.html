      <p>do kzroses just not really care about the state of the group anymore and believe
it&#x27;s a lost cause or something? bc i feel like they&#x27;re the ones who could
actually make a change - even if it was miniscule - since i swear i vaguely
remember that wake1 has done damage control or made changes after that sort of
thing before. like the entirety of intl zrose twitter was finally deeping the
situation and losing their minds but nothing&#x27;s gonna happen positively with the
group for their last few months despite all that.. like they should crash out in
the members plus chat subscriptions or at least ask them questions about the
group and activities to get the ball rolling OR mass tweet idk idgaf</p>
