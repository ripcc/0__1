      <p>yeah its because of political tension the past 2 days &amp; hariboz aint sick &amp;
zerose need to stfu about how other mainland chinese zeroses can go but not
them? yeah maybe cuz they wont lose their career/ future career in china but
hariboz might like wake1 dumb but this was the best choice imo and health reason
was the best excuse even tho we kno its bs at least deters it away from politics

      <p>why would they lose their career in chn for visiting taiwan anon its not like
theyre gonna hold taiwan flags or anything esp how theres literally a chinese
actor who just recently(last week) went to taiwan. yes those two countries are
in a bad relationship but they arent at war like rus-ukr, if the chinese and
taiwanese fans are agreed that its probably a visa thing, why would 3rd party
keep assuming its political situation duh health reason was def not the best
choice when they literally made the actual sick member keep performing on the
stage, its painting the two members who got pulled out in a bad light yknow</p>
