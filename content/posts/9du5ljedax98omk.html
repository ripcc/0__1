      <p>eh I don&#x27;t think tr is as religious as people think he is ðŸ’€ from what he&#x27;s been
saying it seems like he was literally just in church to sing in the choir, he
hasn&#x27;t been to church in a really long time now and regularly makes jokes
related to church (jokingly saying &quot;hallelujah&quot; and &quot;amen&quot; in response to a
religious fan talking to him ðŸ’€) aside from that i don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything
pointing towards his standpoint when it comes to voting (he&#x27;s really careful
about showing colors though)</p>
