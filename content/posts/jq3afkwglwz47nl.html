I mean peoplw can date who they want but why are people persistenton making
labels redundant

Like just be queer or anything, why do you have to use these words

( i mean I'm bi and do not see the point. Suppose there's two amab twins, look
same dress up the same, have a similar personality but one identifies as a man
and the other non binary, and you say you can be a lesbian if you date one but
not the other like???)

I get sexuality isn't as rigid for people but these definitions just aren't it</p>
