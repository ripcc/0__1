      <p>pretty sure all of them have a &quot;no touching&quot; rule, at least the tbx ones do but
tbx makes exceptions for the fans they like i guess? thats why k-teobis are
always having aneurysms when they see the polaroid pics hj and sw take with
pretty fans/especially j-fans lol bc technically touching isn&#x27;t allowed but if
the idol is okay with it they usually suggest it to the fans (there was audio of
one of them saying oh we could do a hug for the pic) or they do let the fan do
it anyway and wave off the security guard</p>
