      <p>saw this in another mond but do you think jao has some kinda connection now with
an embc producer or smth because they’re kinda giving him a few gigs with that
dorm panelist then his drama cameo and now he’s narrating their travel show
considering it’s a korean broadcasting station so they’re a bit conservative and
all</p>
