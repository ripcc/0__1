      <p>Unpopular opinion: For a bit I used to not like w00ngki's performances but I was
conflicted about it because I was thinking I was homophobic or had something
against effeminate men but then I realized some twinks lack versatility and that
it actually isn't internalized homophobia to not like that. I have the same
hatred for masculine performers who can't shake their hips to girl songs. I just
hate how overcorrected people are because the second you give constructive
criticism to anyone with even a dash of twink everyone will accuse you of
everything under the sun. All this to be said, the group that is going to come
out of Un!verse League (I think they're called AH0F?) has like 3 twinks and 2 of
them (w00ngki and shuaib0) lack that versatility in that regard and can only
pull of cute or sexy but in a feminine way. They lack the ability to do harder
concepts without sticking out or making it softer, which diminishes the creative
direction. I wish they'd take a page out of NCiT's Ten's book and learn how to
perform both masculine and feminine. I'm tired of one-note performers who can't
pull off both, and I'm equally tired of masc boy group members who don't commit
to girl group dances and twinks who can't do a hard song without softening it.
Does this make sense? Am I going crazy? Am I in the wrong??</p>
