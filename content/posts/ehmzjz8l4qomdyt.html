      <p>the show was so messy from the start why did the haobin gv dorm get a 10 minute
long intro of their dynamics and like slowed down zoom ins of their room
contents meanwhile in the trgwyj dorm they showed yj for 2 minutes waking up,
then showed tr and gw rooms for 2 seconds each with neither of them inside and
then just moved on to the mtrk dorm like what kind of biased treatment is this
lmao</p>
