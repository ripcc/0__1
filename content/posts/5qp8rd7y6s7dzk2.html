      <p>oh man im not prepared for the amount of tweaking and conspiracy theories that
are gonna come out of their appearance on the manager i wonder which of them
theyâ€™ll focus on cuz the show usually is centered around one manager and the
others might just get mentioned</p>

      <p>ctfu if that happens considering i&#x27;m pretty sure most zroses i see who think jw
is in the dorms thinks he&#x27;s living with mt and rk so either that&#x27;ll be a wake up
call if he isn&#x27;t with them OR staff will somehow try squeeze him in, maybe sit
him in the dining area or something lmao</p>
