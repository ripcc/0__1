      <p>Pretty sure people already speculated Worksop was already casted and they were
just promoting that for hype. I donâ€™t even know where people are getting Workdol
from because itâ€™s all public things and someone would have spotted him but no
oneâ€™s said anything seemingly even his ssngs who usually know the tea havenâ€™t
hinted at anything either making me think itâ€™s an internal thing.</p>
