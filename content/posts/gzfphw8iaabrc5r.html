      <p>For me my bitterness depends on why they chose it ðŸ˜‚ like if itâ€™s filled with 2
stars because everyone else wants to avoid it because the song is high and
intense and the dance is hard then Iâ€™ll be ok because my goats are the only ones
who can pull it off but if itâ€™s a case of no one is interested Iâ€™ll be bitter</p>
