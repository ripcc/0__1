      <p>Forgot if it was the same admin, but there was one that was invited to an event
with ZgH, and she later boasted she had spoken to (read: cornered) him and told
him about what the fans want (read: schizobabble) and they'll support him in
what he does (read: what they THINK/HOPE he does). Apparently ZgH was quite
spooked after that encounter.



Talking abt schizobabble another thing they do quite well to deflect from their
wrongdoings is to go "oh the ledgers? Oh yeah we'll post it soon.....SEE LOOK AT
ZGH POOR THING THOSE 8BACKS ARE BULLYING HIM AGAIN!" those "schizobabble" I've
personally thought they use these deliberately to drum up negative sentiment to
goad the fans into thinking he's alone and only have them so they buy and buy
and buy.</p>
