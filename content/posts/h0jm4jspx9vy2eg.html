      <p>This is where I think kpop stans get ignorant to real like issues because hrbz
not going is definitely because of the political tension between china and
taiwan right now and itâ€™s only gotten worse recently like no one could have
predicted the recent escalation so it probably wasnâ€™t even an issue when wk1
agreed for them to be there. Especially when other groups with chn members were
still doing events in Taiwan. Them not going is more for their own safety than
anything ðŸ˜­.

      <p>china taiwan relations have always been rocky but jb1 and other chinese artists
have gone to Taiwan several times including this year but it just so happens the
relations have gotten extra shaky just this week and the event was booked months
in prior when it was better they probably tried to get the visa to work till the
very last moment but it didn&#x27;t as taiwan is extra cautious about letting in
Chinese nationals into the region this week</p>

      <p>just googled it and it was on the 29th here so 30th in asia, the day they were
supposed to go to taiwan but it was china that deployed it. I really don&#x27;t think
it was a visa issue with everything we kno because the small yuehua aunty also
went like I can totally see yh telling harib0z to not go last minute just for
their future sake tbh bc if u know c-ent those patriotic bastards gonna use this
against them somehow and say theyre siding with taiwan

      <p>Omg queef! I need to correct your anon real quick. China didn&#x27;t nuke Taiwan.
This is so funny. China just sent bomber planes to Paracel island in the South
China sea because of the recent military activity of US and Philippines, not
even Taiwan. The planes were seen on May 17 and left on the 23rd, so nothing to
do with May 30 haribose fiasco. The news are just posted on the 28th. Remember
this popular actor Jackson yee, he was in Taiwan on the 21st while the Chinese
bomber planes were in Paracel island. So this has nothing to do with KTPop.
Please, it was visa and nothing else. Please post this queef because we don&#x27;t
want misinformation in this space

      <p>The amount of misinformation and extremely stupid conspiracy theories obviously
written by people who don&#x27;t understand a single thing about china-taiwan
relations is just pissing me off now ðŸ’€ especially shippers who are literally
trying to drag him into shit by making completely inaccurate judgements of his
political stance while villainizing people correcting them</p>

      <p><p>drag who? and sorry if this isn&apos;t correct I assumed since it&apos;s reaffirming the visa stance which most cfans have agreed on it was a take on smth of that nature</p></p>
