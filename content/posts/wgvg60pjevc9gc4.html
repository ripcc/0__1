related stuff (kinda like kd) after d word. because by that time bp2 maybe comes

think.</p>

      <p>they&#x27;re 100% moving him into their dramas to make space for whoever they get
from the next bp2 season to mc mcd but the treatment hb gets is giving a mix of
minhyun and kd</p>

      <p>using wanna one as the reference, daehwi was mca mc from 2018-early 2021 (in
2018, mcountdown didnt have a fixed mc it was global mc crew thing with new
lineup every week and daehwi became a fixed one in 2019 after wanna one
disbanded and after that daehwi was replaced by miyeon and nam yoonsu and then
hb happened). after wanna one disbanded tho, mnet kinda dropped the members.
they disbanded in 2019 but mnet only started to use minhyun as their mc for boys
planet (2023) and kdn for street dance series (started in 2021). mnet didnt even
invite any of them to MAMA post disbandment and only invited them for wanna one
reunion in 2021.



honestly rather than minhyun or kdn, mnet treated hb like daehwi. bp2 obviously
wont be more popular than jebwon just liken how jebwon couldnt be more popular
than wanna one but before hb happened, daehwi used to be the their favorite
choice to mc (he was mc for kcon too) and then got dropped after hb happened.</p>

      <p><p>this def makes more sense in terms of treatment but while zbwon was never as popular as wanna1 they were still huge on their own i just dont see that happening w this b2p group their popularity wouldnt be enough to look past mnet connections imo</p></p>
