      <p>I was watching njs case were the maknea birthday cafe event was held by bnnie
which was planned for 4month &amp; expected maknea to attend but when she didn’t
attend, nor acknowledged it so that fansite

Were disappointment &amp; shut down after while she apologised with handwritten
letter as we all know how weird &amp; strong parasocial relationship nj have with
their fans, it make me curious if they were caught in dating with someone who
isn’t idol would Bannie still support them or would cancel them as fans did with
Karina were I believe Karina relationship with their fans is not even near
compare to njs parasocial relationship but they are famous as her so I was
thinking, are they still gonna support njs</p>
