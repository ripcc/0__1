      <p>Wanna one also moved out from their dorms 6 months before disbandment so this is
not the first time this happened, moreover their lease will probably end this
june, since it&#x27;s an annual contract. And it&#x27;s also a known fact that once idols
show their dorms to public that means soon enough they will move out</p>

      <p>isn&#x27;t this a known fact tho? I mean, I saw kfans discussing about this all the
time and they said both wannawon and izon moved out a few months before their
contract ended because close to disbandment the members were seen going to and
off work separately, although in izon&#x27;s case some members moved out later than
the rest (probably the jp members). But this happened a few years ago and things
could change, but seeing the pattern now I think it would be more or less the
same</p>
