      <p>Gym rat here... saw Wookie&#x27;s most recent tiktok and am jealous of how he&#x27;s
built. Tall, wide shoulders, wide rib cage with well-sized hips. If he ever
decided to get ripped it would look really really good on his body type. I don&#x27;t
think he&#x27;ll ever have thunder thighs but that&#x27;s okk. He should (imo) work a
little on his chest though, you can tell he&#x27;s been growing his back/shoulder/and
arm muscles but his chest is a little behind, therefore making it look a little
unbalanced (sometimes guys work out everything except their t!tties and it ends
up looking off - look at Benson Boone&#x27;s recent album cover and you&#x27;ll know what
I mean by disproportionate. You can be super fit and lack the distributed muscle
gain for it to look balanced). But, seriously, his physique is so nice and (if
he ever wanted to) he&#x27;d be good at body building. It drives me a little crazy
when people call him fat because he&#x27;s really not, he just has a muscular and
skeletal foundation of a greek god. I wish he wasn&#x27;t limited and nerfed by
Korea&#x27;s skinny E.D.-loving aesthetic and kpop idol beauty standards. In an
alternative world, I really do wonder what he would&#x27;ve looked like if he&#x27;d
become an athlete or cared less about being skinny. I say this all as someone
who wished they had his physique because I&#x27;d be an unstoppable body builder if I
did.</p>
