      <p>This shat (NBD Comeback trailer) trended at 3 in korea and you still want to say
its not normal that S00bs show is in the trends in Korea? There are ways to fool
the trending lists. I also never believe anything coming from Hybe but thats a
topic for another day. Fooling Yt is Way easier than fooling X after Mosk took
over. We cant lose to NBD... JEBES ON YOUTUBE KOREA TRENDS NEXT

      <p>wow anon the bitterness might actually kill you like omg whatdgjrjjr you're
still on this... üò≠ do you even know how much clout and engagements bnd content
gets on kr twt and on kr yt...? they're literally so popular with middle and
high schoolers and besides if you're a real group stan why are you trying so
hard to belittle smth a member of the group was on? you think xtx international
fans are gonna "manipulate" korean yt trends for 3 days, cosplay as korean
casuals in the comments and on instiz asking about zh and give more buzz to HIS
ep than the previous one which had a xtx member? brughugir just accept every var
show he was on this year did well bc it's good for the group if ur a real group
stan and let it go, jealousy be killing some of yall out here ngl</p>

      <p>How is me saying how things actually are belittlling someones achievements?? I
know that the 5B1 are more popular than the XTX boys in Korea, one look at
Ktwitter will tell someone that üò≠ Im just saying that its pretty much expected
stats from MY side when it comes to S00bs show. I know that this appearance is
one of the most watched shows for this promo(?) period üò≠üò≠ I know how to read
numbers</p>

      <p>"i know how to read numbers" the two prev vids without guests only had like 300k
views and 500k views and the one with another xtx member didnt get as much as
engagement as jao's one so no anon its not much expected solely because its his
show. it all depends on the content really, one look at the comment section and
you'll get that. not saying your fav xtx is not popular but the guests and the
topics play a big role in attracting the casuals to watch the ep so idk what are
you trying to say tbh</p>
