      <p>That doesnâ€™t make sense since they both left cb and joined bp under different
companies. If that was the case they would have been close to all the other cb
trainees ex trainees on bp but they werenâ€™t. Plus their families seem super
close too so they are definitely more than surface level friends.</p>
