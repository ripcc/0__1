      <p>tbh the first difference that soob has with bg is that you can see that every
friend that he has (jao, ar1n, epipen members) talk about how soob is a shitty
texter, but he said that he talks with beomgyu everyday and during his hiatus
there wasn&#x27;t a day on where he and BG wouldn&#x27;t text.

we also have this story and tbh between them there&#x27;s other similar stories.



the shippers who are more into this ship can add other things (i like them but i
don&#x27;t really care that much about tee ex tee ships)</p>
