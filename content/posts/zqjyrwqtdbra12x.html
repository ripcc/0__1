      <p>i'm predicting that the comeback - or at least prerelease single - will be
announced monday (or maybe tuesday so it's exactly three weeks til the rumoured
prelease single date of july 14th) kst 🤔 i haven't noticed it myself but from
what i've heard kpop companies don't tend to post content/teasers on the
weekend. idk if it's usually a news article or social media post from official
accounts that comes first but if some sort of teaser is posted to twitter it'll
probably be at midnight and if it's an article it'll be sometime during the day,
probably morning.... i hope i'm right 🤞</p>
