      <p>i&#x27;m predicting that the comeback - or at least prerelease single - will be
announced monday (or maybe tuesday so it&#x27;s exactly three weeks til the rumoured
prelease single date of july 14th) kst 🤔 i haven&#x27;t noticed it myself but from
what i&#x27;ve heard kpop companies don&#x27;t tend to post content/teasers on the
weekend. idk if it&#x27;s usually a news article or social media post from official
accounts that comes first but if some sort of teaser is posted to twitter it&#x27;ll
probably be at midnight and if it&#x27;s an article it&#x27;ll be sometime during the day,
probably morning.... i hope i&#x27;m right 🤞</p>
