      <p>resident reddit lurker here i saw there was an unpopular opinions thread on the
subreddit so i clicked to see what zrs were talking about and lots of ppl were
saying mt is too cringe with the fan service and rizz stuff like woah chillâ€¦.
like at least mt provides other shit with his talents and nice personality, we
have the real enemy who is jw who gives nothing but then i remembered reddit is
wngdngie hive so nvm, like i was even tempted to comment some shit but #nah itâ€™s
not worth it. one thing that interested me is someone saying mt and tr probably
arenâ€™t as close as they seem (ehhhh idk if i agree, theyâ€™ve never come across as
â€˜soulmatesâ€™ but like theyâ€™re still close) but what really got me was them saying
tr sometimes looks annoyed at mt like aroo? ðŸ‘€ have you noticed that or anything
like that bc i got flashbacks to gyubrae beef and how that was so obvious but
maybe thereâ€™s more iâ€™m missing</p>
