      <p>It looks like Hb went with Fendi and Gucci dropped Jw because of that ü§£ü§£ This
doesnt look good for Jw because everybody felt like he was pushed along for the
Gucci thing but now it really looks like that was the case. Jw appeared with no
Gucci sponsorship TWICE to the airport and both times Hb was wearing Fendi. I
know that Zh has something going on with Gucci China. I wonder why they wont
dress him for Airport appearances tho. Im saying Gucci China because if he was
with Gucci Korea he would have gotten dressed everytime the other two do too or
attended the events in Korea. I also wonder why luxury brands dont want him more
in Korea. He is always getting the Chinese version of the brands. We get tvat he
is Chinese but he is still a Kpop Idol?? Dior seems to have dropped Yj and thats
why he is stuck with Barrie and thats about it I guess when it comes to
sponsorships within the group. I know that Gv got some Prada bag as a gift and
stuff, I wonder why they wont dress him even tho they send him Pr.</p>

      <p>sponsorship in airports doesnt really mean anything tho yj has been sponsored by
dior but he still go to events for barrie gyuvin was also sponsored by fendi
today but he still mostly promote for prada theres no ties for these unless its
an ambassadorship and rumor is hyung line filmed smthg for gucci recently too
they only put zhg on events in kr if they would not have it in cn last time when
he didnt went with jwhb i knew he would have somethng with gucci cn and he did.
