      <p>saw this in another mond but do you think jao has some kinda connection now with
an embc producer or smth because they’re kinda giving him a few gigs with that
dorm panelist then his drama cameo and now he’s narrating their travel show
considering it’s a korean broadcasting station so they’re a bit conservative and
all</p>

      <p>This is one of those rare cases where being a foreigner helped him get gigs. The
drama character is taiwanese so hiring a chinese/taiwanese person makes sense,
and the cast of the travel show went on a trip to china so it also makes sense
to have a chinese person do the narration. But I also think he might&#x27;ve gotten
close to an embc pd lol we&#x27;ll see. If they also give him a drama ost then I&#x27;ll
be convinced someone at embc likes him.</p>

      <p>&gt;need a cn or tw actor to play a tw character

&gt;hire zho

&gt;need a cn narrator for a travel show in china

&gt;hire zho

And nothing for rky fr 😭😭😭😭😭 damn nobody wants him or what. Reminds me of
that special knowing bros(? episode with foreigners where mtt and zho went but
rky didn&#x27;t, then there was that jtb&lt; show with foreigners again where everyone
and their mamas went but rky was forgotten once again... like iirc mtt was in
one of the eps as a special guest because zho invited him but what about rky?
😭😭😭😭 Why didn&#x27;t zho invite him too? Where&#x27;s the cn to cn solidarity?</p>

      <p>anon if you&#x27;re a fan you&#x27;ll realize why they&#x27;d prefer jao over rik no shade and
i&#x27;m not even talking about popularity. just look at the state of rikdans. while
jao is busy being a kboo, what exactly did rik do to appeal to the korean
masses? sure his 독기 image worked for the non-fans but that&#x27;s exactly what made
his kr fandom decreased by a lot. non-fans would admire him but once they become
a fan and realize there&#x27;s nothing they can fangirl over, they will eventually
leave (it happened already). yes i don&#x27;t deny that he got nothing from the
company but he did not put in effort either so it&#x27;s very frustating. he got
positive responses thru that risabae and dorm contents BUT he fumbled it
by...not posting much to promote him further. nevermind pchat, he should&#x27;ve used
that moment to post more on instagram or do some silly tiktoks but no he did
nothing to keep the hype. he could create his own opportunity just like jao&#x27;s
douyin but no he&#x27;d rather keep his mysterious image💔💔💔 all of his fansign
regulars are chinese, his livestream&#x27;s comment is mostly chinese, he keeps
getting korean egg accs telling him to post on pchat, it&#x27;s just like he doesnt
even care about his korean fanbase anymore. it&#x27;s just so frustating because he
had so many potentials to blow up in kr</p>
