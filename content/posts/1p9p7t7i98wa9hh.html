      <p>Has he been getting fillers ?? it looks mainly like his cheekbones have changed
imo but he&#x27;s talked about losing weight so it can&#x27;t be from weight gain.</p>

      <p>fhhfhrhr that&#x27;s crazy personally i think this is the best he&#x27;s ever looked
(kfans agree too) but i can agree with the lips especially when the makeup is
too much
