      <p>I don&#x27;t know what is happening but his cbar is struggling, they barely bought
him any gifts and the gifts he got were the cheapest options apparently, also
you know how they decorate the delivery boxes with fancy wrapping or gift bags
with ribbons and bouquet of flowers? Apparently they just sent it in a card box
with shen quan rui written in chinese in permanent marker 😭</p>

      <p>She prob hates him because he doesnt listen lbfr 😭 I always found it odd how
she blatantly never pushed him during bp and Ive come to the conclusion he&#x27;s
just hard to control. Also really? I feel like hes changing a bit, hes been
better with pc the past 1-2 month, been coming once a week at least</p>

      <p>dh has always played favorites rk has been the longest trainee and zhg was only
there for 1 year but he was referred to with yj as “our people”😭 Maybe bc they
waited for zhg for 3 years and they just couldnt change rk at all</p>
