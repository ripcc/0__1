WE GOTTA KILL THIS THIS GROUP ASAP. no but in all seriousness watching this
movie felt like being stuck in a torture chamber because they kept mentioning
how badly they want to stay with each other, how they hope weâ€™ll be together
forever, etc like damn i wasnâ€™t expecting a concert movie to be this bittersweet
ðŸ˜­ gv mentioned that he doesnâ€™t know if heâ€™ll ever be able to feel these same
emotions again and that really put into perspective how uncertain their futures
are especially bc heâ€™s right this is literally the height of most of their
careers</p>

      <p><p>You&apos;re actually so cute for filming this HFJJFNDNNDJD YESSS VISUAL EXAMPLE (I&apos;m watching later today actually ðŸ˜†) but ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜– why this making me emotional farkkkkk this actually looks like it was meant to give everyone depression omg.. we talk a lot ab their futures w certainty cuz it makes comprehending it easier but I guess anything could rlly happen like who rlly knows they might be all out on the streets doing nothing. I think it&apos;s the height of all of their careers it&apos;s just produce law but zang ðŸ˜•</p></p>

      <p>commentary for the movie might have been filmed long ago cuz i noticed they keep
mentioning less about staying together this year (remember how often they said
that back in 2023 and 2024) so it looks like most of them have accepted the fact
that there wonâ€™t be a jb1 next year</p>
