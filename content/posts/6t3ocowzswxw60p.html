      <p>it&#x27;s not just about being closest tbh they&#x27;re just also the 2 members who post
the most especially gyv so we end up being terrorised ðŸ˜­ like look at jaobin in
comparison (LMAO i dont rly buy any of the ban shit but the difference is crazy
knowing they&#x27;re always going out together too), even gvnrae hang out a lot but
it just doesn&#x27;t get turned into content the same way

i am tired of them too though it gets to a point</p>

      <p>right there are other close duos in jb1 but 2beenz is just so jarring with their
terror thats why other duos seem lacking (content-wise) in comparison when its
actually normal, those 600yuan contents are just not normal</p>
