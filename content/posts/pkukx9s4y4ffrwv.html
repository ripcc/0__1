      <p>ive said this before but allens are actually really dumb comparitively to rsins
I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong they&#x27;re both terrorists but rsins are gaslighty twist
ur words but other than some of the schizos with 30 followers they keep their
drags vague and subtle so they can have plausibility of denial and say things
like &quot;oh so asking for fair treatment is being an akgae?!&quot; whereas allens
especially big ass accs will straight up say dumb things like this in public
it&#x27;s a wonder how zrses only jump rsins but it kinda aligns with the new zrses
joining in talk we had cause most allen akgaes went into hibernation anyone
whose been here since 2023 would know how annoying they used to be</p>
