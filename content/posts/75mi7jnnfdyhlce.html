      <p>I diddd it was a bit awkward from the start like I think most zrses that were
around when it happened know he only started the live bc there wasn’t any space
for him to fit in gv &amp; gw’s live, but when he started it, he told them and they
were like “no, why are u going live? u can’t go live without making an
announcement, u can’t be live” it wasn’t even an especially entertaining live bc
he was staring at himself in the camera for the majority of it or doing aegyo
and not really saying anything…. but he was having a good time i guess and even
when gw told him to check kkt asap he just smiled and nodded like it wasn’t a
big deal 😭 when he ended the live his goodbye was lighthearted so I don’t think
he took it seriously until he actually got yelled at. I wasn’t on gv’s live to
hear it happen but the clips are hard to watch too since it’s obvious gv &amp; gw
had no idea what to do mdmdjf at first gv was trying to talk over the noise and
gw kept looking at the door</p>

      <p><p>oh wait I meant the twt zroses/ryangis not u because they like to act like it all went down without reason. Like can we rlly be surprised he got in trbl for going live without permission at the same time as gywk WHEN WE KNOW THEY CANT DO THAT 😭. what&apos;s the diff between this and getting yelled at by ur boss at work and rky wasn&apos;t in fear jcjfjfjfndmd. We def shouldn&apos;t have seen smth like this its just weird and uncomfortable as fans and watching gywk made it worse CUZ THEY KNEW THEY FUCKED UP NGJFJDJD. I was watching the gyv live when it happened and it just got soooo awk like muted at some point and gwks face dropped. rukidans were angry at the time and I mean I got it they were afraid he was getting discriminated against but it turns out the manager was from his yh then they dropped it </p></p>
