      <p>i saw the sappy message about anniversaries and just gotta also jump in, jb1
really is that group. like I&#x27;ll always mourn that we really had THE GOATS of
GOATS as a group, literally a group full of so many talent, and really distinct
personalities that suit a lotta different demographics. we got singers that
SING, dancers that DANCE, RAP KING WOOK, and honestly say what you want about
the discography, they at least can perform and make it their own but also show
variety of genres. the engagements we had pre-debut to around September 2023
were competing against huge 4th gen groups (just saw their first group pic and
video, not the one with their hands/right on 4/20 but the more casual one) and
it reached like 12 M views....like damn. it&#x27;s always shitty management that ruin
everything. can&#x27;t do anything now but imma just say through the highs and lows,
it really has been so much fun to get to know this group, many firsts for me
personally as someone who has liked kpop for like over a decade but jb1 was the
first group i properly stanned (bought albums, participated in voting, etc.).
will bleed blue till the end &lt;3</p>
