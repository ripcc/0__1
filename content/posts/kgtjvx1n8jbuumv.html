      <p>all of them lurk on xhs and weibo to get tea to drag the other one so it&#x27;s safe
to say they have selective vision for a lot of things</p>

      <p>nah as someone who does entertain the idea of jaobin being real Idk where this
idea that chinese jao fans think jaobin is real came from? believe it or not a
lot of chinese jao fans don&#x27;t even think he&#x27;s gay and even believed him when he
was joking around saying that he&#x27;s motae solo ðŸ˜­ they&#x27;re all gf stans. even the
chinese jao fans who do think he&#x27;s gay including the hardcore ones who dig a lot
into his past don&#x27;t think jaobin is real. i&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re right there&#x27;s
definitely selective vision going on and i don&#x27;t think it changes what we think
of jaobin that&#x27;s just the overall perception over there it&#x27;s very similar to
kfan mentality except with additional akgaeism added that would make people even
less likely to call it real</p>

      <p>well he was violently outed and without consent anon not to mention the people
who took advantage of the situation to spread countless baseless rumors about
him for clout when they didn&#x27;t even know him irl so obviously his fans are gonna
try to ignore/forget about it as much as they can it&#x27;s traumatic especially as a
cfan who was there from the start people were trying so hard to get him kicked
out of the group, other sfs united and made a ot8 supertopic that was just full
on jao slander, his searches were a mess yeah it was really terrible</p>
