they pooled funds for allure and until now its still isnt sold outðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… But since
his cfans were begging for this i expect that they would at least surpass yj

      <p>I mean itâ€™s not sold out on ktown but itâ€™s still sold over 600 copies on ktown
which is quite good in comparison to other mag covers from the group sold there.
You have to remember allure was also sold on a lot of k sites that donâ€™t post
their sales</p>
