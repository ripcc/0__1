      <p>what is this referring to bc i feel like there was so much going on with
her???????? ðŸ˜­ now that i think about it i assume this is about the drama where
she was messaging people about kyu1kyung and w0ozi dating in the past and other
idols dating, her having a crush on v3rnon (though that might&#x27;ve just been her
sister&#x27;s doing), members clubbing while underage and sneaking out of the dorms
which made pl3dis install security cameras in their dorm, xiy3on getting berated
in some meeting with pl3dis ceo etc etc (those few days on twitter were gold
there will never be another kpop scandal like it) but ngl my mind instantly went
to when her brother was crashing out which was like a year or two before the
other scandal... all i remember is something to do with stds, being a horrible
brother and his gf being involved in some way ðŸ˜Ÿ</p>
