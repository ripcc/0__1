      <p>She&#x27;s just someone who makes videos to defend them against hate on tiktok. She&#x27;s
really not an anti. At most, she was just slightly shady and said lsf got
dragged for their vocals (a fact) and she&#x27;s not even hater level but they&#x27;re
calling her international sojang? This is so overblown as an attempt to drag njz
and whatever she said was really nothing compared to the njz haters she was
responding to.</p>

      <p><p>Thought so it would be weird if they hung out with someone who had anti posts all over their acc they&apos;re not stupid. THEY CAN NEVER MAKE ME HATE NJZ IDCCCCCCCCCC looking at the pics you can tell how sweet they are and the messages were cute. I just think ot was naive to dm the fan but it was meant to be harmless anyways so what does it matter </p></p>
