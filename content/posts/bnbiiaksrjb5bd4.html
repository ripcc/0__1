      <p>I smell a comeback. Mcd is on Thursdays and guess which day falls on a Thursday
this year? July 10. Full album July 7 Iâ€™m calling it now! The tour being in
October is throwing me off so letâ€™s just ignore that</p>

      <p>gwk said he was recording songs (plural) today so it must be jb1 related and for
wk1 to be recording three months in advance seems very unlikely</p>
