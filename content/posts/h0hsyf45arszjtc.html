      <p>have u guys not seen that viral dick explanation pic? ðŸ˜­ usually guys with a
bigger protruding bulge means their dick is short so they stick out but guys
with flatter straighter bulge appearance means their dick is longer so they can
tuck it ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>It kinda depends tho cuz sometimes you see the bulge but no print then yk itâ€™s
short but sometimes someone canâ€™t have a big bulge but also a big print. Idk if
itâ€™s unclassy to send vids like that here ðŸ˜­ but I remember when hbn was a topic
of this on cc someone send a vid where you could see the print too kinda and
thatâ€™s how everyone started saying he was big, the bulge convo actually started
later when they started putting him in tighter pants</p>
