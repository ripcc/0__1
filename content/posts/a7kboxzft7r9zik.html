      <p>maybe it's just me but i dont really care about c popularity that much?? i mean
yeah if you want to have a career in that industry or you want big sales to
boast i would care but if my bias is korean and have a career in k-industry i
only care about the domestic recognition. but still i appreciate cfans that
support my bias tho</p>

      <p>imo having c popularity is a testament of being popular in korea bc usually the
only idols who are popular here are the ones who are already popular in korea.
only longstanding and big 4 idols have that privilege even da8 and j*n from sv.t
who are cidols had to earn c-ent for years and ofc h*be</p>

      <p>SM gave so much importance to Chinese market during 2nd-3rd gen. Their idol
groups that don't have Chinese members have members who are fluent in Chinese
like DBSK and SNSD. SM's peak was EXO. YG artists are just too talented to be
ignored by Chinese fans. Hybe is still trying to enter and I think, only Enhypen
has some relevance there now. I don't think they like BTS there. But nowadays,
only the top idols in Korea have bigger fandoms in China</p>
