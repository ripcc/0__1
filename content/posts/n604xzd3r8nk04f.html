      <p>This shat (NBD Comeback trailer) trended at 3 in korea and you still want to say
its not normal that S00bs show is in the trends in Korea? There are ways to fool
the trending lists. I also never believe anything coming from Hybe but thats a
topic for another day. Fooling Yt is Way easier than fooling X after Mosk took
over. We cant lose to NBD... JEBES ON YOUTUBE KOREA TRENDS NEXT
