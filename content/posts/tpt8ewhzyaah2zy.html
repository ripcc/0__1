      <p>Bnd getting dragged so bad on weibo ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ apparently their concert in Bangkok got
cancelled due to the earthquake and they didn&#x27;t notify the fans or say anything,
they quietly and quickly just flew back to Seoul without letting the fans know
so that they don&#x27;t have more competition for plane tickets since everyone is
trying to get out of there</p>

was crazy and they didnt say a word until they landed in korea it&#x27;s crazy and

the concert were mad as shit and unstanned them there&#x27;s posts with 100k+

      <p>i remember that time when hao was returning from his fs or some solo event,
there was one fan who fell down and the manager beside hao gave her a really bad
look plus hao ignored her This posted by some krosin on x, not with the
intention of dragging hao but it caught non fans and they all started bashing
hao and the manager, i remember it got like 1M+ views in 30-40 mins but other
rosins started asking her to delete so she deleted it and went private. These
situations are taken very seriously.</p>
