      <p><p>&quot;to rest&quot; so what they do everyday 😂 right.. it&apos;s a schedule most likely that&apos;s the only they stay behind for if gyv was feeling unwell they&apos;d prob just take him home it takes an hr to get back</p></p>

      <p>even if gyv got sick or needed to stay fsr why would hbn have to stay 😭
realistically theyd just have one of their managers stay w him its not like
hbn’s presence will nurse him back to health</p>
