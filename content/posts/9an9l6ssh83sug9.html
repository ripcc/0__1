      <p>Saw someone say hb might mc for wswf which wouldn’t surprise me since he’s
already an mnet mc, idt kd can do it since he’s going to the military and he’s a
dancer. I just think it’s it’s filming the same day as mca that a crazy amount
of overworking also proves someone’s else point they said on ns about it not
even being a favouritism thing anymore like this is just straight up using him
on their part</p>

      <p><p>This is from 4 days ago I archived since u said it&apos;s just a rumor but now that it&apos;s partially confirmed I&apos;ll postttt. I&apos;m gagged at how this type of schedule and filmings even supposed to work it&apos;s speculated he&apos;s going to be guesting on that key show too apparently like this all reads as impossible... and ik mainly it&apos;s mnet double dipping in their resources so they don&apos;t have to hire outside of it but it still makes me go hmm.. he rlly lucked out working for mnet 😒😑..</p></p>
