      <p>the fansign issue is trending on instiz with a massive amount of comments

<a href="https://www.instiz.net/name_enter/95643377?page=1&amp;category=2&amp;k=%EC%A0%9C%EB%B2%A0%EC%9B%90&amp;stype=9">https://www.instiz.net/name_enter/95643377?page=1&amp;category=2&amp;k=%EC%A0%9C%EB%B2%A0%EC%9B%90&amp;stype=9</a>



so that other fan accusing them of lying is stupid because that&#x27;s going to be
the image of zb1 fans now when most people were supportive ðŸ˜­ some dumbasses are
blaming zb1 too
