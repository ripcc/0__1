      <p>It actually amazes me how many fans they still have and how I keep seeing ppl
saying they joined the fandom THIS year?!!! Cause I can&#x27;t imagine tolerating
this shit for any group that wasn&#x27;t them let alone join later on with no prior
emotional attachment like they&#x27;re #THAT goated to still have this many ppl
invested in them even after 1 billion things went wrong</p>
