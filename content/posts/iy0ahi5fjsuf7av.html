      <p>her reactions were crazy bcs it took them over 3 minutes to guess the song title
with guessing feel it pop feel that pop and everything BUT feel the pop and she
wanted to WIN. she's is competitive, not dating anyone. also ftp was most likely
played bcz of na pd and he is the last person to want to even attempt to expose
yj for anything, she's like a daughter to him</p>
