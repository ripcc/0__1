      <p>If Anon is talking aboug this one... Most comments and even the title are just
aboug Durian and how much it smells. There are a few SB fans in the comments too
but thats about it.... More like a new Durian smells bad is this and that rather
than "Let me actually stan this other guy who is with the Hybe Idol on here"

      <p>Durian just seems to generate discourse on theqoo for some reason bc his
inkigayo reverse tribute also had a hot post there I think it's in okay
territory as long as the comments aren't direct hate on jao bc unfortunately
especially as a foreign idol sometimes you need shticks good or bad like this to
get your name out there. It could lead to him being known for something but imo
it's better than not being known for anything</p>
