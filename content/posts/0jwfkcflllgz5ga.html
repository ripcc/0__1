      <p>Idk the criminal activities one means he has to prove he didn’t do it? iirc the
civilian defamation claims can be made about anything that damages character and
public image even if you did do what you were accused of but the criminal one
needs you to prove you didn’t do it. Anyway whatever it is I hope it’s actually
cleared up quickly and the truth comes out.</p>
