      <p>Same anon like yes wakeone should have asked all 9 to come do it maybe they did
maybe they didn‚Äôt we will never know. But considering they had no cake no
decorations not even enough chairs we can safely assume this live was not
planned at all and they were really going to leave us for dead on zrs
anniversary so obviously goat5 decided they wanted to do a live for zerose day
and it just so happens no one else joined. Like yes if it was the case that wk1
had no plans to and then suddenly the members asked to do a live, they should
have called the other members. And lowkey stopping them would make no sense at
all, especially since they did an ot9 anniversary live like 2 weeks ago, like
you can‚Äôt convince me they just decided to ban 4 of them. Also idt the other 4
fans pestering on about how they were in fact there in the building makes them
look worse cuz why were they there and still couldn‚Äôt just rock up and sit
silently on the side.</p>
