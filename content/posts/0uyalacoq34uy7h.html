      <p><p>&quot;to rest&quot; so what they do everyday üòÇ right.. it&apos;s a schedule most likely that&apos;s the only they stay behind for if gyv was feeling unwell they&apos;d prob just take him home it takes an hr to get back</p></p>

      <p>even if gyv got sick or needed to stay fsr why would hbn have to stay üò≠
realistically theyd just have one of their managers stay w him its not like
hbn‚Äôs presence will nurse him back to health</p>

      <p>i mean the leader didnt even stay when rik was left at the airport for their
reality show filming at jeju back then so him staying probably had something to
do with a schedule rather than gyub himself</p>

      <p>i still dont get how that airport incident was because of &#x27;sinophobia&#x27;... think
it was just incompetence because the managers forgot foreign members need their
id/ passport to go to jeju. jao almost couldn&#x27;t go on but since he was an adult
he can verify through his number since number is linked to id or he took a pic
of his id/ passport on his phone but rk barely turned an adult so all his docs
probably weren&#x27;t up to date. dont get me wrong it was a shitty time and i felt
so bad for rk but it was clearly incompetence</p>
