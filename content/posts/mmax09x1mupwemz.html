      <p>found out the one on hiatus from izna was jiyoon that&#x27;s sad like she&#x27;s the most
popular members among koreans they just like her sm idk why and now she&#x27;s gone
and the comeback seems floppy, explains jeemin push too had jiyoon been alright
it would probably be her instead</p>

      <p>yeah i’ve seen a few micro-viral kr tweets of jiyoon if they pushed her more
they could become more popular with krns. They like her visuals and her
mannerisms i think she’s very mouselike and cute? I definitely don’t see the
same amount of attention from the other members</p>
