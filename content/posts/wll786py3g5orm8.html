      <p>why do they have gv back in korea for music c0re, he&#x27;s gonna need to go back to
japan all over again in just a few hours ðŸ˜­ like they have n4rin from m3ovv as a
special mc, they couldn&#x27;t have another bg idol as one too to do gv&#x27;s job? they
could&#x27;ve even also have given d0h00n a day off so he wouldn&#x27;t be the only
original mc there LMAO. zbwon are seriously worked to the bone with their solo
shit omg</p>

      <p>he asked for his schedule to be accommodated so he could do muc0re, he alluded
to that on pchat.probably following in hb&#x27;s footsteps where taking time off from
your MC gig because of a different schedule means death</p>
