      <p>if it helps I only joined the fandom recently and tbh when I was in other (4th
gen/gg) fandoms the jebes were just irrelevant, I barely ever heard about them.
most people only know them as the big temporary group atm, the group with ha0bin
(sometimes rcky/jwg), or the gay 5th gen group which...

now this is coming from the overzealous queer side of twitter and tiktok fandoms
but the general perception was more positive than not.</p>
