      <p>october.. that seems too late but ig they wanna get another cb in before
starting so I&#x27;m guessing cb around aug sept ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” but the gap between last cb is
longer than their usual so maybe full album ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” or is it the dreaded japanese
album stuck in there oh hell nah</p>

      <p><p>tooo late.. WHO THE FUCK PLANNED THIS GARBAGE but damn why is everyone guessing so late theyre 2 months fresh off a cb another 5 months would nuke their careers. i def think the full album is next but releasing a japanese one before that when they had a release not too long ago.. BABY FUCK NO</p></p>

      <p>we cant use kkkepler for reference cause their whole thing is diff but just for
curiousitys sake they had a japanese album 2 months before &#x27;disbandment&#x27; and the
final full korean album 1 month before &#x27;disbandment&#x27;</p>
