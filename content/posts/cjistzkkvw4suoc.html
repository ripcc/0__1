      <p>I mean most his fans are focusing on bugs which is how he hit 1 itâ€™s probably
just the older fans that have more time who are able to stream on multiple
sites. Idt itâ€™s a good reflection on fan dispersion tbh. A lot of younger people
donâ€™t stream on melon as much from what Iâ€™ve heard anyway.</p>
