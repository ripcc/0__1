      <p>isn&#x27;t it really uncommon for idols to have pets in the dorms? usually they wait
until they get their own place and are a little washed up so their schedule is
more free to care for them</p>

      <p>ig the cat won&#x27;t be going outside as they&#x27;re in an apartment anyway and lots of
ppl find having ur cat outside questionable nowadays but i&#x27;m surprised he&#x27;s
getting a cat under a year before the group disbands and thus he&#x27;ll be moving
out of that place like wowwwwwwwww the cat&#x27;ll need to get used to the new living
space all over again ðŸ˜­ tbh tho non-bnb members don&#x27;t seem to be doing shit this
year so i get it, it won&#x27;t be too hard to look after it</p>
