      <p>Its kinda funny how Zer0ses try to talk themselves into thinking that the boys
have no control over their Pchts. They forgot that G7u and GW0ok congratulated
H4nb1n on his Bday and started blaming Wkaone for not letting them post anything
about H4anb1ns Bday ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ These people cannot be helped and at this point Im
sure that they dont want help</p>
