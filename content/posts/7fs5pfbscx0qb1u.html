      <p>anon probably saw a couple of people being angry and talking about it and
thought the entirety of his cfans are "discussing" to send truckshshhejw lmao
like do you realize how many people are there, unless there's an official
announcement or agreement it's nothing serious just like on twt people have
different opinions and not everyone agrees with each other, idk why there's this
weird logic of lumping all cfans together and treating them like a monolith with
one singular opinion or one thought whenever a small portion says something but
the same isn't applied to other fans</p>
