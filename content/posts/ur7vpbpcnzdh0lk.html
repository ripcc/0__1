      <p>this is going to be a little long but anon, the copium started when maet said he
drinks with b1n and knows his alcohol tolerance and gushed about the way b1n's
cheeks get red when they drink which heavily implies they get drunk together
whiiiich also confirms that zha0 was exaggerating and doing fanservice when he
told a zerocola that b1n only gets drunk with him whiiiich means that zha0 does
indeed lie in fansigns to make fans happy and we shouldn't take what he says in
fansigns too seriously. he does this with every type of fan, he adapts to
whoever he's talking to and says what the fan wants to hear but jaobinists are
the only ones who pop a vein if anyone dares to suggest that zha0 might be
trolling or saying whatever to give fans what they want, incluiding them. so
when maet said that, they started coping on neospring and saying that since maet
didn't specifically say the word "drunk" it didn't disprove what zha0 said even
though maet literally talked about b1n's alcohol tolerance lmao. then the
magazine came out and while what maetb1n said is nothing new, it shows that they
have a beautiful and healthy friendship they value a lot but jaobinists on
neospring took the interview as a personal attack for some reason, downplayed
maetb1n's friendship, called them estranged coworkers, said b1n wouldn't have
lost their friendship ring if they were really that close, that b1n never met
maet's parents, and overall mocked the depth of their friendship. then they saw
that zha0 described yj1n in his interview as someone he can honestly open up to
and that yj1n immediately notices when he feels down and looks after him which
triggered some jaobinists again because zha0 had apparently told a zerocola that
b1n was the one who always noticed and conforted him immediately whenever he
felt down but the interview now debunks what he himself said in a fansign which
once again proves he's doing fanservice in fansigns and fancalls. now they're
calling what zha0 said about yj1n a "pr stunt" even though it's not the first
time he's talked about how much he relies on yj1n and all the times he talked
about their closeness were in interviews, birthday lives, concert shows and NOT
in fansigns. so basically they think: zha0 saying "If I show even the slightest
sign of something being off, yj1n immediately notices and looks after me" in an
interview, unprovoked (the interviewer didn't even ask him about yj1n) = pr
stunt orchestrated by wk1 and duhua but zha0 saying b1n is the only one who
looks after him to a zerocola in fansigns and fancalls = absolute truth.</p>

      <p>he said it to a mom fan. cn mom fans have this thing where they ask their idols
"how can I have a baby like you?" it isn't meant to come across as pervy, it's
their way of saying they want their kids to be like a mini version of their
idols because they want to baby them and pamper them, but jao thought op was a
gf stan and was like "how can you have a baby like me? by having a baby with me"
lmaoooooooooo 😂</p>
