      <p>do u still listen to any of the bopeul songs? bc earlier today one came on
shuffle and i instantly skipped it and i realised i do that with basically all
of them which is funny bc i have nearly all of them saved and think a few still
hold up to this day (en garde, jelly pop, say my name if iâ€™m feeling corny plus
itâ€™s kinda like some of zbwonâ€™s lighter songs if u think about it) but after
2023 iâ€™ve rarely touched them idk if itâ€™s the survival show trauma or i just
wore them out during the show/before zbwon debuted or WHAT</p>
