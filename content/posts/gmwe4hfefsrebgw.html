      <p>also he does not have any smear campaign like hanbin and he has the cp fans of
gyujin and gyubrick, i would not be surprised if some crosin like his cp with
hao. most importantly, he is part of yuehuaz</p>

      <p>hanbin is shipped with the most popular 5th gen idol there, one of the rare if
not the only korean idol to go on multiple weibo lives, the endless schedules
and promo in all fields since debut but it&#x27;s crazy how he keeps losing fans
there, big part of it i think is that he&#x27;s just plain and boring 💔 like cfans
really love interesting idols idk</p>
