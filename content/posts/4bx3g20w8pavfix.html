      <p>ummm anons got a point theres definitely a gap in hype and budget between the
two events but they are both akaraka. â€˜akarakaâ€™ is more hyped cuz their cheer
squad hosted it for undergraduates while the student council hosted â€˜akaraka
alumniâ€™ the one zbwon performed at for graduates and alumni. but nothing matters
cuz did you see how happy they all are? can other universities invite them too
pleaseee they are great performerssss they can perform your cheer song too!!!</p>
