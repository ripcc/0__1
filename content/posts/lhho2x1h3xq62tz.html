      <p>&quot;On the other hand, member S*ng H*n-b*n showed a professional appearance without
losing his smile to his fans even in this situation, which was praised by many
people. His fan service shone in the midst of this controversy.&quot; control

      <p>CJ making the favouritism waaaaay too obvious is killing me. The post related to
our wookie has waaay more engagement and it started the virality because his
face looks so cute there while op is dragging the girl. But it&#x27;s Janbin only???
The mention is just so random and speaks nepotism ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Idk, he lowkey got the gist to wreck cj? Escaping their hell hole of evil edit
during bp, debuting in zb1, stable fandom despite not getting much, managed to
get his pluschat content free to post by fans (I know cj not liking this at all)
and this incident. Feels like there is a force that caused cj to suffer if ever
they did something not up to gwkie liking lmao</p>
