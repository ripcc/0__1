      <p>you guys are talking about that riy@ngs biggest opp burner acc right?
ADFDSAFFSALKDHFKLSAJFHLASKHF i just saw and no its none of these anons I know
who it is ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ I thought it was my riy@ngi moot who comes here to crash out
but i just asked and she said no its not her and shes friends with a few big
riy@ngi accs and its one of them with 1k followers and she only crashes out with
my moot who hate other riy@angis so they tweak about the same things and what
triggered her was bc apparently shes in another gc with a bunch of riy@angis and
theyd always shit on his pc making fun of it privately in the gc saying theyd
never buy them and would want a refund but when the rukid@n made that tweet one
of them started cussing the rukid@ns out and ig that triggered her and explains
the hypocrite crash out ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ my riy@ngi moot didnt even know she did all that
until like an 20 mins ago im rooting for her too</p>
