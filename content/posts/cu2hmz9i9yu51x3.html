      <p>the fact that you know who were saying the nice looking living room was for
hao2binz because muh gay men are more demure like that meanwhile they live like
messy frat boys and eat junk like high schoolers unsupervised with that cheese
lying on the table is making me laugh these people know nothing about these boys
and they continue to make up these imagines in their heads also no wonder gyuvin
mentioned the rat that one time</p>
