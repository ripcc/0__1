      <p>for some reason i feel like 3vnnes original companies might not want all the
members back if they don't fit their plans for the new groups. what happen if
jellyfish keeps them and we end up with the combo of gnwk k3ita and yuns30 ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p><p>this is a recurring nightmare of mine... it&apos;s just too freaky that gwks company is agreeing to manage them ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜• but the signs are there, yh and wkn WILL be taking their trainees back ynseo included (why put him in a placeholder group if there&apos;s no plan for him and if he&apos;s let go i think hes getting dropped by jf too) kaytas a little worrying since hes from neither company then I rmbr hes short.. chopped.. old... DONT NOBODY WANT THAT WE ARE GOOD ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘‹ I think jf is making a new group or no group at all</p></p>

artist contract. Just like what happened when they were preparing to debut
zbwone, I saw news their bp contestants were released one by one</p>
