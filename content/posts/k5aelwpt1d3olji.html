      <p>not trying to change minds here lol but for those that care for some context,
666 is like internet slang for like awesome - hanbin references this when he
does the ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™ gestures and says like he knows the meme. So definitely not just a
random number and actually a pet name that someone would give their dog</p>
