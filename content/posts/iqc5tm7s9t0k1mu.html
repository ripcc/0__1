      <p>I know you dont care about Jaobin but I feel like Hao is doing all of these
chinese jobs so he can later get out of Yuehua. Rosins are mad that most of his
gigs are money making gigs. It is like Yuehua is pushing for these gigs so they
can benefit from it before he leaves.</p>

      <p>anon duhua always does this with her cashcows and/or the artists she favors and
I suspect it&#x27;ll only get worse for zhao after d day. she hasn&#x27;t done that much
for him in terms of exposure since afaik he&#x27;s only been to one chinese variety
show but he&#x27;s filming another one rn and both Keep Running and Hello Saturday
are very popular shows, especially Hello Saturday since it airs on Hunan TV, the
second most watched tv channel in china after CCTV. so yeah she&#x27;s finally giving
zhao something really really good. I agree she won&#x27;t let him go that easily
especially if the rumors about wang yibo not renewing his contract in 2026 are
true... üò¨ (2026 too... what a coincidence...) but look on the bright side anon,
if zhao becomes one of her favorites she&#x27;ll give him a lot of elite resources
that will give him exposure along with the usual money grabbing gigs.</p>

      <p>the further zh gets into c-ent the more I find myself detaching from him üò≠
happy he&#x27;s getting that $$ but I&#x27;ve been through this before with so many
c-idols and the ending is always the same.. and doesn&#x27;t matter how much he loves
kpop if duhu4 has her claws on him</p>

      <p>Anon this is worded weirdly to me because it&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s disappearing off
the face of the planet. Why don&#x27;t you just try watching things in c-ent then? I
honestly think he can be more authentic to himself without the language barrier
and have more diverse opportunities there. It&#x27;s not a bad thing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

      <p><p>I think it&apos;s a convenience thing switching ent industries turns ppl off. Like I think in terms of career choices it&apos;s a secure path I&apos;d rock with it but kpop fans obv wouldn&apos;t want it </p></p>

      <p>agree I also think its the case of convenience like if they are only going to c
ent for him they have to learn all about c ent culture and how to navigate c
platforms etc. for people who are already accustom to one industry it may just
seem like more effort than its worth especially if all their other fav artists
are in the k industry. on another note I think zgh won&#x27;t go into c ent fully for
about 2 years ish, I can see him debuting in the yhz new bg probably as the
leader and I think the whole lkz push is because yjn is going to be centre of
that group and the more they get both sfs used to that duo now the less worse
the pushback from that decision will be ? anyway if they do make a new bg I can
see one release mid late 2026 and then 1/2 in 2027 and then zhg moves into c ent
and the bg carries on without him or they have a silent disbandment and do unit
stuff or solo stuff.</p>
