      <p>i went to look at the pic and there seems to be another cigarette box on the
table as well so that could be another member&#x27;s, also his or maybe the
sasaengs???? though idk why they&#x27;d have korean cigarettes (at least for the
raison one), that&#x27;d be less likely since i&#x27;m p sure they&#x27;re chinese. i was
unfamiliar with the brand mentioned so i looked it up and it being french and
cat themed does fit him a lil too well lmaoooooo</p>
