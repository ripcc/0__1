      <p>why do kpop stans and especially zroses care about custom mics/earpieces so much
like idgi am i supposed to be excited? is it solely for bragging rights? bc
whenever i see one of these solo focused/translator accounts post about a clip
from a zepisode or whatever with their bias using one of these mics paid for by
their solo fanbase and they&#x27;re like &quot;omg look he&#x27;s using the mic from his fans
and is so grateful for us and this is so cute and blah blah blah ðŸ¥¹&quot; i&#x27;m just
like &quot;????????? okay&quot; bc like what did this add to my life, why are we gagging</p>

      <p>it&#x27;s also because custom mics and earpieces are very expensive and unless
they&#x27;re gifted by fans, artists won&#x27;t get custom stuff until years later when
they&#x27;re more successful and can afford it themselves. pretty sure there&#x27;s only
one place in Korea that does custom in-ears and everything has to be produced in
the US then shipped to Korea or something like that so its a lengthy process too</p>
