      <p>you say that anon but ppl still go crazy over x1uh4n and were holding weddings
for them years after l*han had left XO so you never know.... plus larries still
exist too and bnb is arguably, to some (including me so maybe i&#x27;m biased lmao),
more likely to be an actual thing than those ships so i feel like people would
be likely to follow them more since it&#x27;s viewed as a &#x27;real&#x27; relationship. like
sure i could see lots of people drop off but i could also see people continuing
to ship. it&#x27;d be hard to keep being dedicated considering the content would be
even less so maybe more as a side thing</p>

      <p><p>There will be the larries of jbnists but I&apos;m assuming anon meant the intl fans which are most of what ppl find annoying they&apos;ll mostly die out no shade they&apos;ll still have their larries tho ofc and occasional hit tweets when ppl mourn the group </p></p>

      <p>prev anon here yeah no for sure the larries will still be there like every other
big ship, but most of the normal shippers will dip and tbh you can only be
interested in something that you don&#x27;t even get content of in so long so they&#x27;ll
gradually disappear too becoming a tiny minority, but yeah like queef said fans
will still reminisce for occasional hit tweets lol, i&#x27;m not a shipper and idt
they&#x27;re real but i see why you&#x27;d think that, all those big ships you mentioned
thought the same thing about their ship too</p>
