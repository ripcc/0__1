      <p>they never said theyâ€™re nb, they just said their concept is genderless (i
remember one of the members in an interview said that this term will be hard for
intl fans to understandâ€¦.. now we see they were very much right ðŸ’€), not that
they themselves are and they seem fine with being referred to with different
pronouns but that doesnâ€™t mean they identify that way in their everyday life (in
a way it reminds me of how cis men drag queens get called she/her in drag but
then outside of that they just go by he/him or even just gay men casually
calling each other â€˜sheâ€™ in a joking way). that actually annoys me about their
fans like i know it can be a bit hard to understand, there could be inaccurate
translations or such but i do feel like it is misinformation and can be harmful
to them to say they came out since thatâ€™s such a huge thing that not many idols
have done and i mean vaguely gestures to the state of lgbt rights in korea.
clearly the members are queer or feel a connection to the community, maybe some
of them are actually nb and not out, but having androgyny be your groupâ€™s
concept is different to actually coming out ðŸ’€ this reminds me of when jo kw*n
said in some interview a few years back that he was into genderless fashion or
something and everyone was acting like he just came out as nb like guysssssss
pleaseeeeeeee</p>

      <p><p>they probably have only an intl fanbase so its no wonder hgjfjfhgfjd things rlly work differently it actually takes nothing for fans to take liberty on identity so the genderless concept was def gonna be reinterpreted its cool theyre open to anything tho. idk to me it was obv was they meant but hopefully it doesnt get worse than just annoying discourse jgfgjhjedk</p></p>
