      <p>the one thing that lowkey annoys me about mt sometimes is that he really does
not know shit like i know it&#x27;s a bit irrational but like C&#x27;MON !(*@)(#!)(@*!)(@@
HE&#x27;S ALWAYS SO CLUELESS ABOUT EVERYTHINGGGGGGGGGGG thank god he&#x27;s charming and
tries in other ways bc otherwise he&#x27;d be giving
rk-not-giving-a-fuck-about-a-single-thing energy. he can&#x27;t play games on shows,
he doesn&#x27;t know any celebrities etc etc like him mentioning jungw0n from en-
during the k1m yun4 photo being shown had me like ?????????? YOU CANNOT BE
SERIOUS, YOU HAVE LITERALLY TALKED TO HIM. maybe he was trying to say they
looked alike but it didn&#x27;t come off like that considering he DOESN&#x27;T KNOW
SHITTTTTTTTT</p>
