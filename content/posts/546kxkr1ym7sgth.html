      <p>Bnd getting dragged so bad on weibo ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ apparently their concert in Bangkok got
cancelled due to the earthquake and they didn't notify the fans or say anything,
they quietly and quickly just flew back to Seoul without letting the fans know
so that they don't have more competition for plane tickets since everyone is
trying to get out of there</p>

      <p>it's awful and a lot of ppl probably won't unstan because fans can forgive
almost anything but many cfans have been disillusioned and realize that they
dgaf about their fans. people hate on cfans for being dramatic but i would be
pissed too a few cfans are missing or can't be contacted and lots of young fans
are stuck in a foreign country during an earthquake it's a stressful scary
situation to be in. bnd can't predict when an earthquake will happen but they
should have said something earlier or at least been more sympathetic</p>
