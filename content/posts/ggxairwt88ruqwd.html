      <p>Have you heard of the Wonyoung Sense magazine sales drama? Yujin global posted a
data of Kpop artists sales and Yujin is #15 or 16 and she's the highest female
(of course #1 is our Haohao). Wonyoung's fans are protesting because Sense sold
more but the sales don't reflect since Sense has no ISSN. I guess it was already
pointed out even before the release that the magazine is kinda operating
illegally hence the attorney's statement because it can also damage Wonyoung's
brand</p>
