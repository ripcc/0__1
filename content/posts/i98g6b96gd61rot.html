      <p>maybe it&#x27;s just me but i dont really care about c popularity that much?? i mean
yeah if you want to have a career in that industry or you want big sales to
boast i would care but if my bias is korean and have a career in k-industry i
only care about the domestic recognition. but still i appreciate cfans that
support my bias tho</p>

      <p>imo having c popularity is a testament of being popular in korea bc usually the
only idols who are popular here are the ones who are already popular in korea.
only longstanding and big 4 idols have that privilege even da8 and j*n from sv.t
who are cidols had to earn c-ent for years and ofc h*be</p>

      <p>Thats because most of them stan the idols for their titles (especially centers)
or because of their looks/physic. Once an idol doesn&#x27;t full fill their need,
they throw them to the side and stan another one. Thats why most of those
girlies are old ü§£ü§£ü§£ They have been around and have never stuck with one idol</p>
