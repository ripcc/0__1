      <p><p>ur right its less common for new groups but its vital for svs groups its the one of the only ways fans can see them as a group and shed the competitive image. like bonding moments are so important to the fd atmosphere they didnt get yrs of training w eo compared to other groups</p></p>

      <p>If you&#x27;re from the same company a lot of dorms are re used ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Duck i forgot
which company but their dorm was used for 3 gens and a tweet went viral on kside
2 months ago calling out the company for being cheap ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ So maybe that&#x27;s why
too the company don&#x27;t want to self expose how cheap they are</p>
