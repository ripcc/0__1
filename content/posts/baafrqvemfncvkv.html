      <p>Y&#x27;all wouldn&#x27;t like to hear this but I have been seeing bulge videos of kpop
idols in xhs, they posted that one video of janbin and haehyun during mc behind
where haehyun was looking at his bulge, and everyone in the comments were like
&quot;I don&#x27;t know who he is but he looks small&quot; probably because of this.

      <p>Yall forget to take into account that these Idols are skinny af. If his P was
small it wouldn&#x27;t even show up like the first picture. On that MCD behind you
could sometimes see Hb move to the side and that&#x27;s when you knew that it wasn&#x27;t
just the top (usual part) not having enough room, it was the whole thing ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
I dont think his is MASSIVE as most think but its def not the case in the
picture either. Its probably mid sized, thicker than most and curved at the top.
I also feel like his would be on all the time just cause of his personality, no
bad thoughts. It feels weird writing this down.</p>

      <p>lol different anon but I knew he had a big p because he never sits with his legs
together and my ex was the same ðŸ˜‚ like last anon said not massive but not small
at all. I only noticed because I asked my ex why he was always man spreading and
he said men deadass trap it if they close their legs ðŸ˜­</p>
