      <p>apparently thereâ€™s a korean taiwanese trainee who is also one of the visual
trainees and who i thought would be the favorite korean ala janbin and heâ€™s
lowkey a yjn clone but if heâ€™s half taiwanese no way koreans would be fully
warmed up to him right i canâ€™t figure out whoâ€™s gonna be the mnet pick tho</p>

      <p>This guy? He's Taiwanese. As to why he's on planet K instead of C I'm assuming
because he's Taiwanese and we all know the Taiwanese China drama.

      <p>imo i think it has nothing to do with race but where (china or korea) you want
to promote/ debut in. like you can be chinese and want to debut in the korean
group because you want to promote in korea so you apply/ join planet k</p>
