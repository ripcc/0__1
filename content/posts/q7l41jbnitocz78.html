      <p>some jyubrikers are shading other jyubrikers for “jumping ship” to ig jjangyz
but the thing is jjangz for some reason lowkey blew up in an rps way based on
old clips from the tour too like skdjkdk dk if it’ll actually stick tho so maybe
they’re being dramatic but some are saying it’s cuz there’s less content of rik
in general and they shld actually be speaking up for his mistreatment like
mistreatment in what hdjsjdk</p>
