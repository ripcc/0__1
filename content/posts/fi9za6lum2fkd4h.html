      <p>Not a rk stan but I was reading that ex riyangi neo and do u guys think he
avoids it cuz he&#x27;s struggles to communicate in korean? Communicating already
isn&#x27;t his thing and having to communicate in a diff language prob puts him off
it even more is my guess</p>

      <p>he does not struggle to communicate in Korean whatÂ ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i feel like some 0s
think rky is way worse than jao at Korean but he&#x27;s just as good imo and writing
in Korean is a lot easier than speaking it so the communication issue wouldn&#x27;t
make sense for pchat where he can type and use autocorrect and double check what
he&#x27;s trying to say</p>
