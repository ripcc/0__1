      <p>I like the likkle fun gay things but whenever they do something like this I get
upset because I just know those trolls get more ammunition with their whole
they&#x27;re only known for gay things agenda I just wish they could be more known
for their talent because they have so much to offer even in this vid they showed
such good singing but whatever I&#x27;ve learned to accept that while zeroses do have
a huge annoying problem with their gay focusing it&#x27;s not a problem exclusive to
us as a fandom but kpop fans in general caring more about things like this than
talent no matter how much they claim otherwise on twt anyways I don&#x27;t mean to
dampen the mood tho I know gunwook was crashing out in his head when the game
started</p>
