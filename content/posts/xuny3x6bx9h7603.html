      <p>ik bc of the language barrier, ì¤‘í‹° can come off a little negative but i can
assure you its used in a loving way. (if they want to be racist, they&#x27;ll use
actual slur ì§±ê¹¨ instead). btw the chinese guys that dont like &quot;ì¤‘í‹°&quot; is probably
referring to youtuber yeo danoh&#x27;s boyfriend(hes chinese). she also popularized
this term.



and its not something rsns always do, every chinese idols stans use this term
(thanks to yeo dandoh). basically its just like how kpop stans love to say a
male idol with long hair &quot;looks japanese&quot;. it has no malice in using the term
