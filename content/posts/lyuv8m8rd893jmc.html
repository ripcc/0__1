      <p>we all know that wki is so shit at scheduling things but this year has been the
worst so far. the back to back jp release-drdr pre release-bluepa album was
their first mistake and now they&#x27;ve been jobless as A GROUP for months ugh i
wish the back to back release never happened so we could get more contents in a
longer period ðŸ˜’ also it fucked up both jp &amp; kr comebacks, the jp was messed up
because there&#x27;s kr comeback so ofc most fans would prioritize the kr one (we
still havent reached the jp mv goal where they&#x27;ll release a special mc with
baseball outfits as a gift lol) and the kr comeback couldnt be promoted to the
fullest because they&#x27;re promoting the jp release in between and now we&#x27;re left
with little to no group contents for god knows how long because this company is
being run by fucking donkeys with 0 braincell which then resulting in fueled
schizos even more. dont even get me started about their tour schedule which is
an utter garbage. the company being shit is one thing but i think we gotta start
holding the members accountable too like they&#x27;re literally not acting like
they&#x27;re under the same group sometimes ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ i still cant believe gyub out of
people is the only member who usually feeds us with ot9 stuff</p>
