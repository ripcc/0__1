      <p>Nah it canâ€™t have been that bad because they still evnn3 made after jb1 debut
and worked with wk1 for macau merch and dh herself was praising jb1 and talking
about non yh members. Plus later in the thread they even said b2p was supposed
to be centred around the yh trainees so it seems like they worked well together
in ways that benefited both but from what this thread says it seems both sides
were too greedy and couldnâ€™t settle on a profit split (for the new show group)
and thatâ€™s why they fell out.</p>
