      <p>Oh they&#x27;re Def Including Japan for sure. I&#x27;ll be surprised if they include other
Asian countries 😭😭 there&#x27;s just no time to do all that. Especially since USA,
Canada and Europe is being considered. I wonder if Australia is in it too. I saw
someone speculating it&#x27;ll be included.</p>
