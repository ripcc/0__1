      <p>this is srsly all that evil ginger white demon&#x27;s fault. everything she speaks
i&#x27;m like HOW IS SHE 27????? there&#x27;s a srs problem in the sapphic community where
all the lesbians are bisexuals, the bisexuals are straight, and all the real
female homosexuals have turned to some form of bigotry/lescel-ism (i am gay this
is a very very broad generalization what the fuck is comphet blah blah blah )</p>

      <p>im gay from a conservative town and i figured this shit out in middle schoolüò≠
anyway i get what anon is saying but she gen cant shut up abt her hs boyf, which
makes her lesbianism look like some weird revenge fantasy. plus she was lusting
over some indian male actor a short while ago. like just be bisexuallll</p>

      <p>On some real shit this is super harmful. Some people don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re
lesbians until late in life and that doesn&#x27;t make them any less gay. She talks a
lot about that relationship with that man because it was clearly traumatic and
formative, that doesnt mean she&#x27;s not gay. This is kinda wild</p>

      <p><p>i never said she wasnt gay and ive read her interviews as well i just mean especially in the recent decade where the simple idea of what a lesbian is constantly debated its gonna raise question. im obviously not in her place or dying to write her off either but this sprouted from jojo and the online presence convo </p></p>

      <p>Too lazy to pull up the clips of her talking abt her boyf but she has a song
called coffee where she talking abt how she cant meet up w a man cause shell
have sex with him lesbians used to kill themselves over this shitüò≠



And idk i just think that monosexuals have an easier time figuring this out bc
in my case and my les/gay friends, ur kinda slapped in ur face during puberty
like i felt like a teenage boy



Anon is pulling most of their rhetoric from the masterdoc, which was written by
a woman who later came out as bi. I do think comphet is real, and i did
exprience it by choosing a random popular boy i never interacted with to &quot;crush
on&quot; without any actual feelings or attraction after the gay revelation. The
definition of comphet has just become so warped (bc of the masterdoc)



Like i have read abt this lesbian writer who wrote carole/the price of salt
during the 50s and she forced herself to marry a man by admitting herself to
conversion therapy and and would describe sex with a man as just feeling like
rape This clearly isnt chappell, who seems, by all accounts, to genuinely have
had feelings and attraction for that man



I think some woman just dont realize u can be bi and only date woman. U dont
have to fuck and date everyone ur attracted to‚ù§Ô∏è
