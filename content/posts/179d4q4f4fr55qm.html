      <p>people are &quot;fragile&quot; because some of them are literally disgusting towards jao.
excuse me anon for not finding it funny how some of them are homophobic and they
almost call jao a wh..re just because and for perpetuating the idea that all gay
men are promiscuous</p>

      <p>bnbists take this shit too seriously imo. no one actually thinks jao and soob
are dating irl. it&#x27;s just like when ppl say hbn loves to flirt with yeonjn, maet
or the neos, but no one really believes he thirsts after all of them at the same
time or that he&#x27;s a manwhore. many zrs like to say the boys flirt with other men
all the time and some call them sluts but no one actually thinks they&#x27;re sluts,
you know? rps is fake and most ppl are aware it&#x27;s all for fun and not real but
bnbists for some weird reason take rps so fucking seriously and act like
shipping jao or hbn with anyone else is a hate crime. I&#x27;m saying this as a
lesbian btw, you guys are ridiculous. no, being a jao multishipper doesn&#x27;t
perpetuate the idea that gay men are promiscuous.</p>
