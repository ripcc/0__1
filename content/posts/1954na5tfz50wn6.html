      <p>Which is why they have a bad rep among korean kpop fans. Their behavior comes
off as very aggressive and people try to avoid them because they are here for
good vibes. Alot of them are also either brainwashed by cfans or are actual
cfans who can speak korean. You can never trust with what tea they will come to
you because most times its their own speculation üò≠üò≠ How else do you think the
whole new Wak1z thing came to be? This behavior is also one of the reasons why
most kfans dont want chinese members in a group. Most cfans are just too batshit
crazy and think they own everything because they open up their wallet a lil bit
bigger than most ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è You can always say not all but it will always be most.
Anybody who will try to say thats sinophobic doesnt want to understand the real
problem/concerns. Most korean kpop fans think that idols like Yu9i are great, as
long as my own fav is not in a group with them.</p>
