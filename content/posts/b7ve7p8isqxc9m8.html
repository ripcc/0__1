      <p><p>... uhm.. I feel that we&apos;re starting to spiral.. you could be onto smth but their cb would probably be around the time b2p starts airing? So what then</p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pjt-knowledge.appspot.com/o/content-attachments%2F23b5ba4e-6e53-48a4-918a-ae50c7669d08.jpg?alt=media"><p></p></p>

      <p>Ok I donâ€™t think exactly like anon but I do wonder if they are prolonging the
gap between their next cb as much as possible because itâ€™s a full album and will
be their last. Like in their head if they release it too early they will spend
the rest of the year with nothing new. I fear in wk1s mind they may actually do
aug/sept so we have full on promotions that go straight into the tour and then
award season.</p>

      <p><p>yuppp if they released in june theyd have a gap pre tour theyre probably gonna stretch the promotions by 0.1 only for full album vibes ðŸ˜’ and then poof bleakness idt theyre deeping the svs group too hard theyd basically cut their promos period if that was the case</p></p>

      <p>idk maybe they&#x27;ll do one of those disbandment singles ðŸ˜­ that&#x27;ll really kill me
but idk i feel like a final goodbye like that is deserved and makes sense with
their fame level (even tho i don&#x27;t think w1 or iz0ne had one but like that was
like 7 years ago and their circumstances would&#x27;ve been a bit different + but
then at the same time wake1 are so trash idk if they&#x27;d even plan for that and be
able to get it together. disbandment singles are always shit and feel like
nothing so could be for the best)</p>
