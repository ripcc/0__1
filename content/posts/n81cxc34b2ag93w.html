      <p>the point of the show is for the guest to introduce something they&#x27;re a fan of
so that&#x27;s why ðŸ˜­ it was pretty fun tho but i just think jao is funny as hell</p>

      <p>Of course his kfans are gonna support whatever he does or whatever S00bin
does... Theyre their fans?? Its bad for an Idols image to be only one thing and
people not even knowing your name on top of that. This will bring him nowhere
once he redebuts. I find these shows and topics around Durian and Zhs love
around it funny too but I personally dont want Durian to be his thing. If you
know how the Kindustry worked you would know exactly why. Theyll use him for
that and then discard him when someone new comes (which is very quick)</p>
