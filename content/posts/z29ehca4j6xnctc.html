they didn&#x27;t make zh and rk do weird pr apologies and just act as normal/say they
are not feeling well and should rest instead or whatever those pchat messages
were. and just sent yj back home too if they wanted to commit to the lie that
much like ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è there was definitely a way to handle this that wouldn&#x27;t require
2 statements about the festival and the whole fandom fighting bcz of that group
photo and interview. wkkk1 are obsessed with throwing shit at this group
whenever they get the chance</p>
