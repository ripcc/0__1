      <p>Bnd getting dragged so bad on weibo ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ apparently their concert in Bangkok got
cancelled due to the earthquake and they didn&#x27;t notify the fans or say anything,
they quietly and quickly just flew back to Seoul without letting the fans know
so that they don&#x27;t have more competition for plane tickets since everyone is
trying to get out of there</p>

It was trending for hourssss the situation was just so shitty overall and the
fans crying and yelling their names and saying &quot;what should we do&quot; and the
members just ignoring them just so weird maybe the managers told them not to
interact with the fans but stillðŸ¤¥ even non kpop fans were dragging them it was
only when they landed in korea that myungjae spoke up in a wvs post lmfao</p>
