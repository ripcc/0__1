      <p>Esp worried abt him because he was actually strong predebut, the dieting has
made him weaker snd has to take a shitload of supplements to compensate

( i think gw and mt have good relationships with food in the group, who else?
But jaobin are def the worst)</p>

      <p>Actually this made me think i remember he carried 2 grown men on his back easily
during bp and looking back thatâ€™s crazy cuz I canâ€™t see him being able to do
that now just because of how much weight he cut</p>
