      <p>Saw someone say hb might mc for wswf which wouldnâ€™t surprise me since heâ€™s
already an mnet mc, idt kd can do it since heâ€™s going to the military and heâ€™s a
dancer. I just think itâ€™s itâ€™s filming the same day as mca that a crazy amount
of overworking also proves someoneâ€™s else point they said on ns about it not
even being a favouritism thing anymore like this is just straight up using him
on their part</p>

      <p><p>This is from 4 days ago I archived since u said it&apos;s just a rumor but now that it&apos;s partially confirmed I&apos;ll postttt. I&apos;m gagged at how this type of schedule and filmings even supposed to work it&apos;s speculated he&apos;s going to be guesting on that key show too apparently like this all reads as impossible... and ik mainly it&apos;s mnet double dipping in their resources so they don&apos;t have to hire outside of it but it still makes me go hmm.. he rlly lucked out working for mnet ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜‘..</p></p>

      <p>Itâ€™s giving lazy on their behalf but icl I even see non fans saying heâ€™s a good
choice for mc. Since heâ€™s a good mc and a professional dancer it made a lot of
sense. But this is the same man that was having nosebleeds before/ throughout
blue promo cuz he was so overworked like they really want him to have to take a
health hiatus before disbandment at this rate ðŸ˜­</p>
