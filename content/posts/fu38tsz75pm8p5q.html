      <p>honestly looking at the rumors of what his potential role is, i&#x27;d actually say
its a pretty good fit for him (a younger taiwanese man who is bf with one of the
main female leads) especially since when he speaks mandarin, it&#x27;s similar to the
tw dialect. it&#x27;s interesting to see a news exclusive about it now (not sure how
normal it is) cause it looks like the drama is supposed to come out in sept but
i also can imagine its to drum up excitement....lowk i hope he gets to actually
sing on the ost cause that would make sense (similar to the xtx sb yj cameo)

      <p>That‚Äôs for tourism. Everyone needs some type of working visa if you‚Äôre entering
a country to make money. I remember oh my grl? tried entering America to shoot
for their album and got turned away because they didn‚Äôt have a performance visa.
But the company lied and said it‚Äôs because customs thought they were sx workers.
Don‚Äôt know why they thought that‚Äôs a better pr statement than saying they messed
up the visa</p>

      <p><p>i was reading a bunch of taiwan visa sites and the short term stay visa free thing includes performing so the work permit the organizers got probably handles the payment bit </p></p>
