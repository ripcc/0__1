      <p>mdkfmsfksdmfsk i was gonna send an ask here yesterday theorising about zbwon&#x27;s
cb being in july as has been previously discussed bc i was looking at their
schedule ahnwana posted and thought july looked p bare and they could fit a
comeback in but then i realised that was the case for the upcoming months too so
it probably doesn&#x27;t say much ðŸ¥± idk i guess i could still see it tho



how are they gonna be overworked yet still give us nothing to talk about.. it&#x27;s
incredible</p>
