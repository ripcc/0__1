      <p>anons are probably confused. yibo&#x27;s contract is rumored to end around october
2026 but nothing is known about jao&#x27;s contract. also didn&#x27;t yh pursue him for 3
years? they aren&#x27;t letting him go</p>

      <p>If its ending at somewhere in 2026 then I guess its possible cause I remember
m1nju iz0ne contract end around 1 year after her disbandment with izone so jao
contract with yh could be shorter. But how does that work cause m1nju was in
actor company</p>
