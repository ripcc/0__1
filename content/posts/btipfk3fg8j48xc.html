      <p>never believe jb1 conspiracy theory but with the way wkone managing jb1 rn do
you think it&#x27;s true that they&#x27;re trying to make their fans turn away from them
and jump ship to bp2 and their future grp?</p>

      <p>the contract extenstion is not happening so of course wkone will prefer to just
invest in this new group that will last for five years hence they&#x27;re trying to
make zbone&#x27;s fans jump to this ship. this is not even a conspiracy theory girl
if you&#x27;re a fan you&#x27;ll notice this</p>
