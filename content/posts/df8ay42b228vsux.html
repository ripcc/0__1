      <p>he's literally wearing a runway look except for the yellow inner.… not all brand
sponsorship requires for it to be a whole outfit i thought we already saw the
proof with zhg mixing adererror with other stuff on airport but ader still posts
him as sponsored</p>

      <p>Giving someone a shout out also doesnt mean that they got sponsored... I really
dont know how yall cant see the difference. Brands dont post the sponsored fits
on their pages, they might do shout outs for the idol wearing their piece but
thats not being sponsored. The brand doesnt post about it because they already
get the visibility they want from the Idol wearing it by being sponsored. I
really thought that Rosins were smarter than Woongdeongies and that they wouldnt
call anything a "sponsorship"</p>
