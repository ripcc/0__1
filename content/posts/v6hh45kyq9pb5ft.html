      <p>Esp worried abt him because he was actually strong predebut, the dieting has
made him weaker snd has to take a shitload of supplements to compensate

( i think gw and mt have good relationships with food in the group, who else?
But jaobin are def the worst)</p>

      <p>So matt is the only one?? I have no idea abt rky but he could too, gyub?yuj? I
don&#x27;t remember anything postive or concerning abt their relationship with food,
maybe jw living along, not influenced by others and idol culture eats better?
But idk</p>

      <p>the only unhealthy relationship rky has with food is the amount of sugar he
consume and he never mentioned dieting (or mention anything in general) so its
safe to assume that hes okay like dat</p>
