      <p>the diff between him and rk is at least se0kryus have other options, other
content to look at so they can ignore the beggary fancalls but for rk all you
have are fancalls with the same fans and i love you wife scripts to every one
LOOLL not shitting on him but yeah and i wonder if rk knows about the parascoial
aspect so thats why he never ups it</p>
