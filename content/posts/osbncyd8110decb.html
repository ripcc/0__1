      <p>Wanna one also moved out from their dorms 6 months before disbandment so this is
not the first time this happened, moreover their lease will probably end this
june, since it&#x27;s an annual contract. And it&#x27;s also a known fact that once idols
show their dorms to public that means soon enough they will move out</p>

      <p>wanna1 still got a whole album promotion after the world tour ended so if this
world tour is jb1&#x27;s last group promotion (before the final con and possibly one
last disbandment single) then i think it makes sense for them to leave the dorm
after the annual lease ends in june. bc idt wk1 would extend the lease for only
3months before they&#x27;re gonna be busy with world considering how cost-efficient
wk1 is (if theyre the one who&#x27;s paying)



but idt only yhz will leave the dorm, if yhz leave then the rest should leave
too after the lease ends</p>
