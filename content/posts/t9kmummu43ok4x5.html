      <p>This shat (NBD Comeback trailer) trended at 3 in korea and you still want to say
its not normal that S00bs show is in the trends in Korea? There are ways to fool
the trending lists. I also never believe anything coming from Hybe but thats a
topic for another day. Fooling Yt is Way easier than fooling X after Mosk took
over. We cant lose to NBD... JEBES ON YOUTUBE KOREA TRENDS NEXT

      <p>wow anon the bitterness might actually kill you like omg whatdgjrjjr you&#x27;re
still on this... ðŸ˜­ do you even know how much clout and engagements bnd content
gets on kr twt and on kr yt...? they&#x27;re literally so popular with middle and
high schoolers and besides if you&#x27;re a real group stan why are you trying so
hard to belittle smth a member of the group was on? you think xtx international
fans are gonna &quot;manipulate&quot; korean yt trends for 3 days, cosplay as korean
casuals in the comments and on instiz asking about zh and give more buzz to HIS
ep than the previous one which had a xtx member? brughugir just accept every var
show he was on this year did well bc it&#x27;s good for the group if ur a real group
stan and let it go, jealousy be killing some of yall out here ngl</p>
