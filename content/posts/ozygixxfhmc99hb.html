      <p><p>oh these are pretty I like them but the quotes are mad cuz he had 0 input and saying this doesn&apos;t reflect gwk at all which I mean sure it doesn&apos;t. I think they&apos;re mad about other things and this just ticked them off, so basically the dcgall was gonna host a bday cafe and then suddenly cancelled it saying they&apos;re gonna make new in ears instead even tho the fans wanted a cafe ðŸ˜­ also there&apos;s beef w cfans over his tiger in ears, the original design was completely ripped off from Chinese culture and she was suuuuper passive aggressive about changing it. gwk made loose suggestions and she put that plagiarized design herself and ppl were mad she&apos;d get him caught up </p></p>
