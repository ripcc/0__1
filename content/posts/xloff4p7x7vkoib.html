      <p>surgery will always turn out better than fillers and I neeeed idols to stop
getting fillers because thereâ€™s too many side effects, migration happens way too
often, and they never fully dissolve despite claims of being temporary</p>

      <p>&quot;surgery will always turn out better than fillers&quot; surgery and fillers both have
different purposes. idols are underweight so its necessary for them to get
fillers or else their faces look too gaunt. nearly every idol gets fillers
(especially the really skinny ones). source: im underweight and i had to do
facial balancing w fillers bc my face just looked too skinny and i looked a lot
better after i did - but its easy to get addicted tbh, I&#x27;ve done it once and i
still wanted to get more (i didn&#x27;t) but when i went to my derm after 2 years of
getting it done he was like your filler from 2 yrs ago still hasnt dissolved im
not letting u get more. yj def got fillers too that&#x27;s why his face looks a lot
fuller than bp era, he&#x27;s just not going overboard like jwg</p>
