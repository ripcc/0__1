      <p>Former Rcky hater who also hated him just from vibes but to be honest it was
simply because my moots were bric3 and we just hated the jebis DKM I SWITCHED
SIDES AND THAT&#x27;S WHAT MATTERS. He&#x27;s just miskeen and misunderstood and I&#x27;ll die
on this hill I love him so much now after getting to know him. A lot of his hate
isn&#x27;t that deep it&#x27;s just stan twitter beef plus he&#x27;s just the most well known
to casuals so he&#x27;ll always be target #1 but a few do cross the line I&#x27;ll admit
that.</p>
