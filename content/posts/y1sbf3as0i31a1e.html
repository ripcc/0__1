      <p>Love when some anon go 2 + 2 = 5 because what&#x27;s the correlation.. also what
&quot;mental breakdown&quot; afaik all members expressed similar things about wanting fans
to stay with them/not wanting them to watch bp2 ðŸ˜­ and it must be worse for jao
and janbin as they were forced to be on the show as well which means their own
fans have to tune in</p>
