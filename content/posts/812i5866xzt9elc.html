      <p>realistically speaking how could we complain to wakeone about the lack of group
content or lives ? if k fans were smart they’d be sending trucks already but ig
they dgaf about this like us int fans do idk…?



spamming the members on pluschat seems to be the only option😭 if we mass
emailed wakeone about it would that even work???</p>

      <p><p>😫... kfans have been complaining since debut and they have sent a truck before but look where we are 🤦‍♀️ its a lot to do with the fandom turnover rate as well, newer fans are gonna be less outspoken but it just feels very tired and wkn is hardheaded AF</p><p></p><p>and emails 🚬.. I had a good laugh.. that&apos;s been the monkeyrose go-to since DAY 1 they dont give a fuckkkkkkkkkk </p></p>
