      <p>explain more for auntie ðŸ˜­ i'm the auntie not you... if you've done any coding
in python before this should be pretty easy

another easier option is this chrome extension but i haven't tried it... but it
should clean up everything for you in a csv file that has the
questions/answers/dates/any other metadata neospring has for the answers in the
page (a csv file is kinda like an excel/google sheet, you can import it to
google sheets or excel and it'll be easier to search through your answers)

      <p>also you can just open the csv file in google sheets afterwards. there's some
redundant columns you want to remove, and there's two date columns (one for when
the anon sent the question and one for when you answered) so you might want to
rename those accordingly... and lmk if you have any questions!</p>
