      <p>iirc jao will have a brand fanmeeting on his birthday? but this summer gayo is
on 26-27 and usually he only stays for one day for a live event that doesnt
include filming + its only 2hours flight anyway so it should be doable to attend
unless they actually have something scheduled on 26-27</p>
