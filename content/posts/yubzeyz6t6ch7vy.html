      <p>you know what i believe, most people especially shippers feel the bad vibes from
jwg but they don't want to admit it and their way of coping is by not wanting
him near their ship, which wdgs think is shippers feeling threatened by the mere
presence of jwg. there are so many layers, or maybe it is just my dislike for
jwg speaking because i just saw a multishippers coke rant about how shippers
especially jaobinist hate jwg after today and how it is because most jaobinists
are against multishipping</p>
