      <p>people should condemn cj more for partaking in ruining kpop. those stans of 2
specific companies be saying &#x27;you ruined kpop&#x27; when the biggest trigger is
produce series. cj introduced a whole system that nurture akgaeism worse than
ever in kpop history, also grow a mindset to stan a group that

 * succeed immediately,

 * become ambassador asap,

 * valuing the bullshit &#x27;hardworking dozens&#x27; or visual over real talent,

 * having high sales on debut but can be stanned in a short time before jumping
   to another hot cake, which is a huge problem actually

before the existence of produce series, sajaegi and payola is more subtle but
the evil seeds cj sow by succesfully created a desirable result from vote
manipulation and rigging cause another big companies cater to blatant payola.
while mid to small companies getting lazy because they could just sent those
nugus to svs if things go awry. yeah s* and h*** is bad but cj deserve to be
cursed by both heaven and earth too!</p>
