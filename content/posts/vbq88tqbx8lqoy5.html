      <p>all the non-lckyz stages were songs they&#x27;ve covered for their birthdays (other
than hb and mt but peaches was already covered at that zco thing) so i wonder if
rk will release a bambi cover for his birthday this year ðŸ¤” so we already know
what it is which lessens the excitement but stilllllll his fancon cover was the
one that was unexpected and what we haven&#x27;t seen him perform before so it works
out</p>
