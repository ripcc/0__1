      <p>i feel like it canâ€™t be anything too crazy because you could hear him in the
background of zghâ€™s live at the dorm at 3 and he did this live at 8 so whatever
it was didnâ€™t film for that long</p>

      <p>Idt itâ€™s rapping tbh since heâ€™s already tried that in bad boy. If they were
working on the album maybe members are finally having input on lyrics and
producing. Ik he did lyrics for his song our light but idt heâ€™s ever done
producing before and he said he asked a younger member so that could be gw since
heâ€™s done producing</p>

      <p><p>dont get me ultra mega lit rn... its possible but the way he posed it as smth he wanted to run away from i feel like producing for their album would be more of a want than an obligation. this has everyone so invested it better be smth worth while</p></p>

      <p>Different anon and I agree but with that same logic I doubt itâ€™s rap because
unless itâ€™s like a b side thatâ€™s 99% rap and all the members are rapping it
makes no sense to give him rap that he doesnâ€™t seem to even lean into over other
members who do rap like gw gv mt jw</p>
