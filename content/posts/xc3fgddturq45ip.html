      <p>my opinion: i think the setlist is decent but the random luckyaz duo makes no
sense for now and only caused tweakings for the biggest schizophrenics but ig if
they switch around the duo for the next 2 days I can get behind it I think some
of the solo performances are lame too but ig the members chose it so girl
whatever and I wish they had more fun segments i really wanted fancon clips to
go viral like 17 dancing songs that don&#x27;t suit them segment or like tvz üò¢ altho
rk bambi is doing decently so I&#x27;ll take it</p>

      <p><p>i just dont see why theyd switch it around like its probably gonna be stuck like this but everyone will have moved on by tmrw tbh. and i get it sure but they dont get to have 4576584 fancons for the next 10 years to experiment like 17 and tvz i think this fancon was just about finally doing one thats not shit and doing things we havent seen/taking it to the big stage like its rlly all gonna be about the anniversary nothing else</p></p>

      <p>Different anon but apparently the members said the fancon days will be really
different from eachother so maybe they will be different. In terms of üçÄ stage
there was a segment at the end where yj literally says he chose kick it and to
do with hao</p>

      <p><p>oh yea I got asks ab that so we can expect some change lol but there you have it I just don&apos;t see why there&apos;s more tweak than just being mad it&apos;s an old song and there&apos;s no solo </p></p>
