      <p>Pray my bias doesn’t become a soloist because I’ve already tried to stan soloist
and it’s not fun. 99% sure his companies preparing a group for him, so I just
gotta pray it’s good vibes because I’m not dropping him 😭</p>

      <p>i know a group is better but it&#x27;s gonna hurt to see him be a leader of a group
that&#x27;s not jebs. and i&#x27;m supposed to care about a group of guys that didn&#x27;t
train together or have that bp trauma bond? i don&#x27;t even like boy groups 😭😭😭
so i&#x27;ll probably just casually stan and check up on everyone during comebacks</p>
