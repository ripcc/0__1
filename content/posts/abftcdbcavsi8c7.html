      <p>maybe i'm biased bc i already don't like him but i watched the jw zbwon_more to
see the members and zh genuinely to me looked annoyed as fuck whenever jw was
doing stuff with him like ðŸ˜­ and then when jw went to give hb water you could
see in the corner zh side eyeing him heavy and talking with gv like i can't be
the only one seeing this</p>
