      <p>honestly looking at the rumors of what his potential role is, i'd actually say
its a pretty good fit for him (a younger taiwanese man who is bf with one of the
main female leads) especially since when he speaks mandarin, it's similar to the
tw dialect. it's interesting to see a news exclusive about it now (not sure how
normal it is) cause it looks like the drama is supposed to come out in sept but
i also can imagine its to drum up excitement....lowk i hope he gets to actually
sing on the ost cause that would make sense (similar to the xtx sb yj cameo)

      <p>was it because of political tensions tho because the festival said they got all
legal permits a mainland china actor was in taiwan like a week ago a3spa was
also in taiwan iirc recently so i donâ€™t think it was so much political as prob
