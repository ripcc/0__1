      <p>Feel bad for 0s whose first time it is watching the fighter series like I’ve
been here since s1 and these people are haters to their core. Like they never
like anything, literally nothing so I need 0s not to be surprised if they shade
hbn because it’s probably nothing against him as a person they are just rude
like that, they do it to all the mcs special mc guest judges actual judges and
give it another ep they will start fighting between team fandoms too</p>

      <p>Yeah in the video he was actually the first one to notice the other team wasn’t
dancing so he spoke into the mic (the audio was overlayed with the song)nand
gestured and the bumpsup team even saw and started signaling to join in AFTER
they saw he said that. At least 0s are clocking people for being weird to him
for no reason like some of these big wswf fans deleted their tweets because even
they acknowledged he clearly did say smth. I think a lot of these fans obviously
miss the old mc so literally say anything about hbn to discredit, which was
especially crazy this ep because in nearly a 2 hours ep he was only seen on
screen for like a minute so ofc people would barely feel his presence ntm people
noticed how mnet is muting his mic out because there’s loads of times we see his
mic go up for reactions during the battles and never get any audio.</p>
