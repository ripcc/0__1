      <p>ok dont get me wrong here but i was thinking will mnet still keep hb for mc
related stuff (kinda like kd) after d word. because by that time bp2 maybe comes
out, theyll prob have their new hb and hb won&#x27;t be an mnet employee anymore i
think.</p>

      <p>they&#x27;re 100% moving him into their dramas to make space for whoever they get
from the next bp2 season to mc mcd but the treatment hb gets is giving a mix of
minhyun and kd</p>
