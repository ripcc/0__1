      <p>nah there was a teaser at the end of the spa extra content, they got to make a
wish and it was to eat meat or something

idk if there&#x27;s gonna be anything interesting all they did in the preview was eat
(which lowkey is usually fun group content for me but with w1 it&#x27;s gonna be a
bore)</p>

are sitting and talking and someone in the ear gives them orders what to do yay</p>
