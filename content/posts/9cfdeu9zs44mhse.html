      <p>the new bp2 ktrainee center is apprently a chop and knetz are ragging on him
he’s also an indv trainee but allegedly secretly in wki so he’s gonna debut and
when he does you’re probably gonna see levels of favoritism never been seen
before</p>

      <p>Hmm idk how much I believe it because having him as individual makes no sense
like what difference would it make, if anything they’d just put him in under one
of their sublabels. Also people have seen some of the other k wk1 trainees
around the building on xhs but I’ve never seen anything about him so maybe he is
just an individual trainee?</p>
