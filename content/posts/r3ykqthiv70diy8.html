      <p>This is so odd and anon deffo a jaobinist because Iâ€™m seeing them trying to cope
after the interview ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ hbn even said it was tough when he lost the ring
which is why they made new ones. Like you said it could be a proximity thing and
it doesnâ€™t matter if they may seem closer to other people it doesnâ€™t mean they
are close with eachother too ? Like you gotta remember they both left the same
company and still stayed so close that mtw was willing to join bp for hbn. I
think they are the two that will still be as equally close post disbandment
because theyâ€™ve already been separated before and still kept close.</p>

      <p><p>I rlly don&apos;t get the debate on their friendship like DAMN CAN U ONLY BE CLOSE TO ONE PERSON GNFNFNNFNFNDM encouraging each other to join bp in hopes of debuting tgthr isn&apos;t some regular degular company mate relationship and agree I think their friendship will be the least tested since they&apos;ve already had distance. </p></p>

      <p>Agree like they had to have been super close for him to agree to join bp.
Imagine being ready to go home and give up and subjecting yourself to a survival
show for months just because your friend is asking you to. Idk what anyone says
Mattbin give friends that donâ€™t need to constantly be around eachother to be
close but will always have a strong friendship.</p>
