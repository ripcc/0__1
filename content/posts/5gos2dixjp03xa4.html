      <p>idk where you're on anon but i'm obviously not talking about specific posts lmao
i'm in a lot of crosin gcs including some an admin of zgh bar ðŸ˜­ also i'm the og
anon not the one that said you would know everything on the cside. but yeah lmao
it's still pretty common knowledge from what i've seen that his contract ends
soon and he was never gonna be in the yhz group anyways that was planned before
he even joined the company where have y'all been brother</p>

      <p>anon i'm also in crosin gcs? no one has ever said that his contract ends this
year there is discourse and fighting every day about his future including
whether fans want him to be in the group or not and this is because no one knows
what he's going to do and when his contract ends. if it's common knowledge i'd
like to see a post on his supertopic or even xhs where people discuss it i'm
happy to be proven wrong. also which admin? ex or current because that matters</p>

      <p><p>the way it sounds it&apos;s a thing only the minority would possibly know not smth that would get posted. but I still feel like it would somewhat shift the general attitude of the disbandment convo I&apos;m all for digging deeper doe like now I&apos;m curious </p></p>

      <p>i mean to clarify i'm not against it if it's true i would like him to have the
option to leave if possible but i'm just not seeing this as common knowledge or
even as a minority thing because stuff like this would spread on wb and douban,
there are many different types of hardcore rsns and none of them have given me
the vibe that they think his contract expires so soon. obviously happy to be
corrected but i just want to know where the source is from or if there's a link
to anything. yh is known also for being hard to get out of, even fcc who's fan
bingx2's little brother was only able to officially leave in 2023 so he spent 5
years with yh and he out of anyone would have had the money and connections to
leave early if he could</p>

      <p>speaking of yh contracts being hard to get out of, what about with w**dz, does
anyone know about what it was like with him? bc i know he left a few years ago
and is now in eye yew's company which is pretty big (also with drowning hitting
big currently, good for him). obviously he's not chinese so maybe it's a bit
different but i would've thought they'd want to keep hold of him after ex won
disbanded and him being the one that seemed to be the most popular/have the most
success out of all of the ex-members of that group. did he have more leverage bc
he'd been an idol for a while, like how he had already gone through un*q,
or......?</p>

      <p><p>his case would be a likkle diff I feel like since he was an artist under yh first then went on a svs but xone had a huge looming threat over their careers and they were disbanded prematurely idt yh would&apos;ve considered that potential and he was a flop up until now </p></p>
