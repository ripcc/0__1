      <p>this is an honest question out of curiosity and not akgae shit. What do you
think is the reason why Hao is not being pushed in Japan when he's the best
seller and Gunhao are still the most popular there but at least gunwook is
getting bags but hao still has no solo or unit projects in japan? He can also
speak the laguage. I'm trying to understand why with so much logic. So far we
have Matt, wookie, hanbin and jiwoong who were given exposure in japan shows. Do
you think it's sinophobia?</p>
