      <p>i keep seeing people saying they've become zroses in the past few WEEKS and
MONTHS like i love them but what could possibly draw you in atp like it doesn't
feel like much is happening content wise and it's not that fun of a fan
experience (i remember i used to be an 0rbit and i unstanned because i couldn't
take dealing with beebeecee anymore lmfao i think i've stayed with zbwon because
my love for them is more than it was for 1oona but also because i feel like i
need to see it through til the end since they'll be gone forever soon. if zbwon
were permanent, it might be different because i've lowkey been equally if not
more annoyed with wake1 than i was with beebeecee LMAO), it just feels like
we're constantly going through hell outside of the members being very talented.
i can't even imagine not being a fan from the beginning like i remember during
1zone's run, i debated looking into them more and maybe even becoming a fan but
the longer they went on, the less appealing it seemed since there was less time
left</p>

      <p><p>it&apos;s inevitable I guess since it&apos;s normal in kpop for ppl to become fans at any point but why zbwon they&apos;re ending like tmrw cjjdjcjkdkdmxk I GUESS THEYRE THAT LIT AYEEEEE. But hold on nah I rlly dislike wkn but BUMBA BEBECE??? Idk the shit I&apos;ve seen them do is insane to me idt we got it that bad wkn remind me of ist more 😭 they squashed tvz popularity in every way possible icb im subjected to this again. but maybe its easier to bear being a new fan when there&apos;s shit to catch up on + experiencing the wkn that makes less mistakes NVNFNMFN LIKE WE HAD IT WORSE</p></p>

despite liking the music and them being talented but I guess our goats really
