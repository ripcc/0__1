      <p>Idk if this worth any note to you but hbs manager stoped liking / posting
anything zb1 related ages ago (she used to post his teasers ect) ik people said
itâ€™s because certain people were being weird about her but idt thatâ€™s it because
he still post stuff about hb just literally nothing to do with the group anyway
but interestingly even though she never liked any non hb post on the insta
before she just liked the m@ttp@rkz backpacker stage video</p>

      <p>she&#x27;s not his manager but yeah i don&#x27;t see her liking stuff from the official
group account as much. she&#x27;s been liking a lot of the ot9 fancon posts and she
always like group stuff posted by directors, stylists, staff etc. even if she
doesn&#x27;t, his ceo is always posting his and the group teasers. not saying that
means anything just an observation</p>
