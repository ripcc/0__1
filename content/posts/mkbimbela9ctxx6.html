      <p>I thought Iâ€™d be happy for the two year anniversary like yay 2 years with zb1
but sis this is hurting me a million times worse than the 1 year anniversary
ever did. I was so far away from kpop and zb1 fr bought back the joy again,
finding them fr felt like finding kpop again for the first time the same feeling
the same excitement and even though there have been lows and a shit company and
shit fandom itâ€™s really hitting me that Iâ€™m not ready to lose them as a group. I
know we still have 9 months ish but this anniversary is making me realise we
wonâ€™t get another, we wonâ€™t get a second anniversary or a second debut
anniversary we are celebrating our last birthdays with them we wonâ€™t get 1000
days ðŸ˜­ itâ€™s hurting real bad now</p>
