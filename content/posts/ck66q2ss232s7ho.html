      <p>anyone got any kpop tea???? i always like finding out any gossip no matter who.
i can start lmao. some days ago, due to that podcast drama mentioning j3nnie and
1u, i came across this asian american youtuber snark subreddit and did some
lurking. they mentioned the y3chan julia ma thing which i'm 99% sure was
mentioned here, they actually went into quite a bit of detail, sounds messy.
anyway, more interesting since it's new to me, i ALSO read that apparently that
chaebol girl who was going to debut in me0vv dated gdr4gon and this was talking
about from friends who went to her university or something, like this is known
in that circle. mind you she's 22 while he's 36 and this would've likely been a
year or more ago. ew</p>
