      <p><p>mtt was asked to choose btwn jwg or hbn (think strictly bp lore) and he chose jwg cuz he said hbn has zgh now and nobody laughed it was silent hgjeirjthytjfk THE TL LOST THEIR FUCKING SHIT ðŸ˜­ at that point half of zrosetwt still hated mtt and everyone shipped jaobin they were like oh fuck no he just outed them it was so fucking funny. everybody back then was a troll so it wasnt that serious everything zbwon did just felt like a shot of heroin so we would lose our monkey minds over a pencil dropping shit used to get serious i miss ittttt. but also 80% of the mtt hate tweets are gone cuz someone went on a fake ass doxxing spree and ppl started mass deleting shit LMAO</p></p>

      <p>this is gonna be niche as hell bc iâ€™m pretty sure it didnâ€™t even blow up and was
probably deleted but i used to follow u when u had a public twt and i was
looking at my old screen recordings a few weeks ago and found one i did of an
edit u retweeted that was about gw finally getting some sort of schedule (so
this wouldâ€™ve probably been sometime in 2023) and it was edited to this drake
song with shit like fuck all1ns fuck ros1ns fuck w4keone and these random clips
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ zroses donâ€™t do it like that anymore</p>
