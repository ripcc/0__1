      <p>i went to sleep part way through so i didn&#x27;t see it but was there no
talking/game section after ha*2b*nz did catallena, tr did up &amp; down etc etc? bc
i thought there would be more casual sections considering it&#x27;s not a full
fledged concert idk i was really looking forward to that ðŸ˜• but damn the staff
must still be traumatised to the response to that 398439248932 minute long fan
service section in the first fancon</p>
