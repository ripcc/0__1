      <p>Okay besides the obvious bp2 picks I think that the @ndrew Han, Hu H@nwen, and
Lee Hye0p guys are great too. @ndrew because of that Dallas accent and the fact
he has been known on TikTok for wanting to be a trainee for over 5 years (and he
can sing), H@nwen because his predebut vids are literally so funny (why he
dressed as a furry and humping the ground ðŸ˜­or as a maid ðŸ˜­ for an audience of
ONLY MEN ðŸ˜­ and then doing Judy from Zootopia cosplay and swinging his hips ðŸ˜­
heâ€™s hilarious), and Hye0p because the dude went viral for being super into
hamsters and asking online for hamster advice and giving recommendations to new
owners, plus selling his old hamster stuff for cheap and giving little gifts to
anyone who ordered from him (honestly so sweet - there was also a vid from a few
days back of him teaching some trainees how to do fan service at the
meet-n-greet and looking proud when they got it, seriously super sweet AND he
can actually sing).</p>
