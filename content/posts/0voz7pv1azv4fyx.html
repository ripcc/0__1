      <p>I think that time the admins arranged with a fancaller/fansigner to ask him
questions regarding his sexuality and to get it on record so they told him in
the letter to say he is straight so that the shippers especially the zghbnists
can finally know their place and eff off..... But apparently rumour goes he told
the fansigner "sorry I can't answer that" so obviously no record.</p>
