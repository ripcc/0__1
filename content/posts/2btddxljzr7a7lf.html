      <p>i see ryangis (noy b mainly) are still as schizo as ever. if the fans who can
meet him irl often feel this way imagine how fans who cant afford to meet him
thru fancalls or fansigns feel? cant blame the fans who want to leave the fandom
when rik himself doesnt even try to keep them in the first place. and them
schizo ryangis will keep barking about the same thing over and over instead of
addressing the elephant in the room ugh shitty company who doesnt promote their
artists well and the said artist who doesnt promote himself well how are fans
supposed to stay

and guess what? after this repo was posted, he still hasnt posted any new photos
on pchat and his latest live(5days ago) was his most recent pchat activityü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i love rik i do but he is starting to turn me into ryangi opp 2.0. he seriously
needs to stop giving those vague answers cuz they only keep feeding those
schizos even more. is there even a way to tell him this
