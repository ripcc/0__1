      <p>listen to me. their boba is better and so chewy and underrated!!! their grass
jelly is so good too. my favorite is a boba + grass jelly combo. the mango
coconut boom is a classic but gets boring but is okay for a first time try.
don&#x27;t get the fruit drinks (the slushie type). they are way too sweet.</p>

      <p>um no their brown sugar boba is boring af after i had it i stopped going there
bc i thought wow heytea is so basic and overhyped? but my friend was addicted to
coconut mango booms and she kept trying to convince me to drink it and i was
like nah I&#x27;ve seen enough. then gyv kept raving about it too so i was like wait
maybe i should try this too... and i tried it. It was SO goodddddd its seriously
such a unique drink u cant get it at any other boba place, the jasmine tea they
use is sooo fragrant even the store itself smells like fresh tea its so nice

also they had two drink collabs with alexander wang here in nyc last month
(metabloom &amp; black grape boom). It was SO good but i didn&#x27;t realize it was an
exclusive and that they&#x27;re never serving it again I&#x27;m killing myself. if i had
known my time with them was limited i would&#x27;ve gotten one every time i was in
soho during may but i was dumb</p>
