      <p>diff anon but i heard about that th rumour since it was mentioned in alice&#x27;s ns,
someone was saying they knew several people who worked at h*be and this was like
a common rumour and no other b*s members had dating pasts involving men. also i
don&#x27;t wanna re-type it all so i&#x27;ll share the original post but i remember this
ask with a BUNCH of rumours from someone who apparently had a source working at
kbs which i found extremely interesting
