      <p>As one of the anon was talking about how in a is doing ok and kep1 flop so tho I
feel genuinely bad for them but that group was supposed to be fail from start
with how best duo didn’t end up even tho some said she wasn’t talented enough, I
really don’t think xioting or bahi should be 1 but 2 &amp; 3 would have make
reasonable also no lie they have no visual even tho xioting has strong charisma
beautiful looks ( not Korean type) she has no one to back her up like Bahi fans
think Baji is visual &amp; international visual barbi but sorry she is typical
western looking face with not outstanding or pretty visuals she just look
western like her brother which differentiate her from other but she not look ok
but not pretty western, their song is bad with poor budget &amp; not a single member
look good any of their concept, they also have no visual chemistry if you look
their group pic they look like K-pop dancer all over the place, their styling
doesn’t help them too, not a single member is known for except bahi as Kai sis,
they aren’t talent or funn enough even they got viral outside fandom atleast
like bm viral for high note, live singing, lazy or over dancing, illit for
controversy, I’ve were also know for their heigh, vocal &amp; wonyoung, lsf for
their choreo &amp; bully &amp; sakura, balled dance,nj for fresh y2k, preety innocent
look, easy listening &amp; their ceo,kiss of life for their bold sexy live strong
performance, gidle for their feminist song, soyeon producing song &amp; their raw
character especially their foreign line &amp; kep1 has not used any of the member
talent ones counting got viral for her dance but wk1 didn’t utilised the
vitality &amp; if you song is tank atleast your mv should be good or be so talent or
pretty visual or else should have come from big4 company they have nothing so
kep1 tank</p>
