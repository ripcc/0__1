      <p>I don‚Äôt think they said what platform but I‚Äôm pretty sure they mentioned
watching a lot of short videos together. Idk what about it is crazy to some
people tho like they live together send stuff together (zh mentioned he and hb
were sending eachother challenge videos when he was in China and planned to film
one) like hbn even mentioned fans wanted to see a tutting challange so it‚Äôs
really not crazy to just assume he was a viral tutting video and recreated it
possible seen it from zh or by himself</p>

      <p>Putting Zghbn aside, I'm half wondering if Hbn does have some Chinese
aspirations....with warming of china korea relations he stands in good stead to
ride the wave as he's well ahead of most of his contemporaries who can only go
ni hao xiexie zhichi wo ai ni gege jiejie (hello thank you for support I love u
noona and oppa)



A significant part of Chinese is in that weird phase of "speak more mandarin or
I'll won't spend money on you." Stage and a couple of Hbn videos of him speaking
mandarin and holding Weibo lives went....well maybe not viral, but he definitely
did attract some new fans that way who liked that he was trying to converse in
their language. So all in all if he really goes solo a possible avenue might be
to see if he can open up a Chinese market with or without his other half ü§îüòÅ</p>

      <p><p>in general kpop companies are starting to venture into China again it&apos;s definitely not up to him but his management but idt these silly trends are indicators of anything he could just like them or be taking requests üò≠</p></p>
