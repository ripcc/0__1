      <p>I saw so many empty seat is zb1 fancon &amp; I was shock I thought they were big in
Korea not as big as big5 but they canâ€™t even fill 1st day fancon ? even during
concert their were many empty seat, is zb1 loosing fans or itâ€™s common for 2
year group, I thought they were gaining fans but thatâ€™s sad for group that gonna
disband next year</p>
