      <p>i watched the zbwon movie a couple days ago and wanted to give my thoughts 😆



i had no idea what i was walking into but the movie isnt a concert re-experience
at all it was almost filmed like a docu (filming quality was cray). idc if i
sound biased but their performance skills are some of the best out thereeeee the
movie rlly highlighted it well. they rearranged the setlist order to fit this
&quot;time of day&quot; concept they had (reminds me of the yits/1stlook interview) they
talk ab their careers in modes of dawn, morning, afternoon, etc. and the
interviews basically followed this where theyd talked ab their &quot;dawn&quot; being
before zbwon or what their lives looked like and then the &quot;morning&quot; was them
waking up or smth. like zgh said star creators woke him up and bloomed him? smth
like that. i was happy they talked ab bp/star creators a bit yess
#neverforgetyourroots #wemadeyou.



their interviews were a lot more sentimental (was surprised by zgh and tr) too.
they talked a lot ab zroses and their time in the past, now, and in the future.
like i gotta give it to them they love their fans badddd i genuinely liked all
the likkle interviews. they showed them rehearsing and even rehearsing at the
dome walking through the seats pretending to be fans. idk that was smth i rlly
liked they put themselves in the fans shoes a lot to understand them. they were
rlly geeked walking out during the encore too.



im someone who doesnt get emotional like that zbwon r rlly just my cry button
cuz icl THEY GOT ME SO FAST I CRODE MY LASHES OFF. overall the production was
amazing, they had great visuals and direction in this movie ive only ever
watched the first btc movie so idk what to compare it to 😭 they did a lot of
&quot;lets be together&quot; torture as expected but it all just felt very sad. they had a
likkle section &quot;talking&quot; to fans from the past on the phone as well it was all
rlly cute just makes letting them go harder 💔</p>
