      <p>This is wild like buying hundreds of dollars of jewellery for an exclusive pc ðŸ˜‚
but also makes me think they really want to work with him/ have an official
relationship with him

      <p>man this talk about swarovski not being as expensive as other luxury brands
reminded me of this cursed -hypen tweet. I hope things don&#x27;t get as bad here
because imagine thinking wearing swarovski is some kind of &quot;mistreatment&quot; ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
-hypen fans are mentally ill

      <p>The funny thing about these graphs is that most of them dont even come from
these brands or newspapers ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Its normal people like you and me making these
pyramids. Akgaes feeling the need to dump on a brands name and rep (Swarvski is
still VERY known and considered luxury) because they are butthurt will always be
funny tho</p>
