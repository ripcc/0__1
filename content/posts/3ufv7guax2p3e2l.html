      <p>Went to take a look at Weibo and Xhs and why do Rosins looove to exaggerate?
They talk as if the whole of China or Kpop fans are talking about their hang out
when in reality its just Jao and Soob fans ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Which is to be expected? Made
me hopeful for nothing</p>

      <p>They have their viral moments for sure there's a post by a soob stan who
unstanned because they were tweaking over soob being close with someone outside
of teextee that went really viral because people found it funny and their
episode also did numbers on Bilibili but on a normal day yeah you're just going
to see stans bored of their groups hyping it</p>
