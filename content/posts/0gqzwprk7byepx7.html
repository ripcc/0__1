      <p>&quot;a few months ago I heard from an acquaintance that its already been decided
which companies the members will go to. I was hoping for a contract renewal too,
but I get the feeling it might be impossible…&quot;

      <p>I know every kpop gp has an expiration date. Even ones from current companies.
The reality of kpop groups are either they promote for a good amount of years
before solo opportunities arise for them. Or eventually they leave for a
different company but say they&#x27;re not leaving the group. (however group
activities would be harder to coordinate)



With sv gps, we know when their contract ends. We know they&#x27;re all from
different companies and we know eventually good things come to an end. For me
personally, it&#x27;s my first time Stanning a sv gp. Jeb means so much to me and
I&#x27;ve heard members mentioning how they want to stay together. If I can have some
power and take them away from horrible wk1 and do that, I would in a heartbeat.
At the same time, I&#x27;m hit with this reality that with the remaining time left,
we should strive our best to support them as Jeb and enjoy the good times we
have them together. Honestly I&#x27;m not ready for d day. I don&#x27;t want it to be an
empty, open-ended type but in the end it&#x27;s the individual companies (and
hopefully members) choice in the end.



Ngl that new anniversary video left me crying. I was already crying during that
fancon but the new anniversary video left me bawling. The members have already
accepted the uncertainty and reality of d day. In their way, all these things
are to comfort us(which isn&#x27;t helping) and prepare us for the inevitable.



Honestly I don&#x27;t think I would ever Stan a gp like jeb again. I don&#x27;t have the
energy and time anymore and I would just want to leave the happy memories I
gained from them.</p>
