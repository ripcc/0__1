      <p>She's just someone who makes videos to defend them against hate on tiktok. She's
really not an anti. At most, she was just slightly shady and said lsf got
dragged for their vocals (a fact) and she's not even hater level but they're
calling her international sojang? This is so overblown as an attempt to drag njz
and whatever she said was really nothing compared to the njz haters she was
responding to.</p>

      <p><p>Thought so it would be weird if they hung out with someone who had anti posts all over their acc they&apos;re not stupid. THEY CAN NEVER MAKE ME HATE NJZ IDCCCCCCCCCC looking at the pics you can tell how sweet they are and the messages were cute. I just think ot was naive to dm the fan but it was meant to be harmless anyways so what does it matter </p></p>
