      <p>I actually like this question because it makes me think like on the rare chance
that 1/2 leave and the rest stay ( I can even see a situation where yh pull out

scenario of loosing hbn he’s the leader and one of the most popular members so
it’s not like we’d be loosing a filler (no shade)</p>
