      <p>Nah his company have a lot of older male trainees around his age that a few of
us know about and that wouldnâ€™t make any sense at all unless they were making a
group for home plus they only started going to older males once he debuted in
zbone. People just discuss njw because he was public but there are a lot of
other trainees in that company now. He probably will do some solo stuff on the
side but there will deffo be a group waiting for him.</p>

      <p><p>idk if I&apos;m rmbring incorrectly but they opened auditions way back when and the starting age was 2001 or smth which is uncommon so honestly I think he&apos;s debuting in a group too. I used to think he&apos;d wing it solo (not necessarily a music artist) but the realities always been that that works out for nobody and his company would prob want him to continue to be profitable </p></p>

      <p>Yeah their audition age used to be in line with the normal 2006 and Iâ€™m pretty
sure their female audition age is still around that but after hbns debut it got
lowered to 2001. So in regard to that other anons ask about them just doing
recruiting for others I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the case because there was no need for
them to lower their audition ages to 20+ at the same time hbn debuted unless it
was specifically to recruit for a group for him. Also iirc I saw that ns too and
the anon never came back with any solid info on that which again doesnâ€™t really
make any sense because why would a newer company who are trying to break into
the idol market recruit for others instead of themselves</p>

      <p><p>right they could take that p7 guy sure but they&apos;re still doing their own auditions creating a group off purely svs losers is a bad idea ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p></p>

      <p>Yeah I seen alot of â€˜idolâ€™ academies(which is how people found out jiwoon passed
the live audition because these academies post the partial names of the people
who pass auditions and for which companies) and tl have had a lot and I mean
alotttt more trainees pass auditions than people would assume and from many
different regions too from America Europe and Asia, so they definitely been
putting in that work to make a future group for him because again their
auditions only really majorly kicked off post 2023</p>
