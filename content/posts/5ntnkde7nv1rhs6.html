      <p>why are they always trying to make it seem like a drag that the other members
express their feelings to their fans and aren't afraid to sound vulnerable to
them? like worry about most of what hb says to y'all being scripted and
calculated ðŸ˜’</p>

      <p>Also itâ€™s the way hbn has said to fans when they ask him at mca and stuff to
just pay attention to them and not look at others ðŸ˜‚like just because heâ€™s not
outright saying it on pc doesnâ€™t mean he donâ€™t feel it to. Maybe they should
look more closely at those mca repos</p>
