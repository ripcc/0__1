      <p>That riyangi opp said when they tweet things like this its actually them
frustrated or disappointed at rk himself but they cant blame him cus they cant
fathom that their fav pisses them off so they blame something like a ban or w1
instead to vent their frustration AND I AGREE plz just unstan rk is clearly not
for u its been 2 years</p>
