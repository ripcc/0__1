      <p>the red light green light game was only funny bc during little yj&#x27;s turn he
asked them to do the thing with the poses... wk1&#x27;s content team really needs to
step it up i saw peend&#x27;s spa episodes and it was so funny they had like hidden
missions and stuff like that I&#x27;m so tired of wk1 boring asses these eps were
like 80% karaoke</p>

      <p>for hidden missions i meant peend had 2 members kind of in a mafia role where
they had to hide the other members clothes without them noticing while they were
filming the ep/those 2 mems had to do missions during filming. then the staff
told them the filming was over and when they went to change into their outside
clothes they found out that they were stolen and had to find them so that was
kind of like a new part, I&#x27;m bad at explaining but its kind of like missions
hidden within an episode with other missions</p>
