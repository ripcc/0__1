      <p>iirc jao once mentioned in an interview that he decided to sign with them bc
they promised that they&#x27;d debut him but they ended up putting him a bplanet so i
guess it makes sense that his contract is shorter than the rest?</p>

      <p><p>a promise is diff than on paper but idk I doubt that they&apos;d make him sign anything less than 5-6 yrs even if that was the case</p></p>

      <p>i&#x27;m lowkey not sure why everyone&#x27;s doubting this because it really is common
knowledge if you kick it with crosins especially the hardcore ones lmao his
contract isn&#x27;t even an artist contract it&#x27;s like 3 years i think</p>

      <p>idk if its the same in jao&#x27;s case but project groups&#x27; members usually only
signed the trainee contract with their OG companies thats why they could debut
under a different company for a certain period of time because signing the
artist contract(5-7years) under two diff companies dont seem possible (thats why
wj/sn and un/iq didnt work, the members ended up staying only in one company)</p>
