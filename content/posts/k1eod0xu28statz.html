      <p>i say with zero intent to sound bitchy but genuinely why are you guys mad that
they highlighted jaobin like they were in the pannel and the most popular faces
for the audience I would actually blame wk1 for starving zeroses for so long abt
dorm content bc i expected it to Not be a balance like we should get that on
their own YouTube channel, not a variety show</p>
