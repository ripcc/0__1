      <p>searched up some jp tags and i saw a zrs recommending zbwon to someone their
mond is kinda big . the zrs said zbwon are a group with no scandal handsome and
talented but the mond owner replied tht zbwon are hard to tell apart and they
only know gwook rcky zhao and she cant fully get into them cause they have a
time limit ðŸ˜¢</p>

      <p><p>I can&apos;t even be mad like I get it it&apos;s a torture sentence to stan zbwon at this point in their careers so much of the love stems from the crazy environment and times we&apos;ve been through. Tbh kudos to those 2 anons who said they&apos;re new fans LIKE YALL RLLY GOT TO SPEED RUN THIS FJFJNFNFN but can&apos;t tell them apart? ðŸ¤” she has to be talking ab f4 they&apos;re the only ones who&apos;s visuals are kinda similar </p></p>

      <p>Ngl 9 people does make things a bit more difficult.....like I came in
immediately after the finale and spent a long while looking at the group photo
and comparing it to other photos that came out after. You&#x27;re gonna kill me for
this but I told Gunwook apart by comparing his hands relative to the rest
(Gunwook-BIG HANDS) then comparing his photo to other photos.</p>
