      <p>Have you heard of the Wonyoung Sense magazine sales drama? Yujin global posted a
data of Kpop artists sales and Yujin is #15 or 16 and she&#x27;s the highest female
(of course #1 is our Haohao). Wonyoung&#x27;s fans are protesting because Sense sold
more but the sales don&#x27;t reflect since Sense has no ISSN. I guess it was already
pointed out even before the release that the magazine is kinda operating
illegally hence the attorney&#x27;s statement because it can also damage Wonyoung&#x27;s
brand</p>

      <p>Sense being weird and kind of unprofessional aside, Starship keeps accepting
random magazines way below her popularity like she goes on vogue, elle in Korea
and for some reason they don&#x27;t get her anything similar in China so wony&#x27;s cbar
had to put out a statement saying they would only mass buy/support top Chinese
magazines because otherwise it&#x27;s just Starship profiting off of her image and
milking her fans.



The biggest issue right now is not even Starship and magazines though it&#x27;s that
dumbass baidu vp daughter who doxxed a bunch of people she&#x27;s screwing wonyoung
over in the public eye for something completely unrelated to wony herself</p>

      <p><p>i feel like the reasons kind of like an underlying thing with her ethnicity in question but its also sse trying to stifle her i rarely see wony fans happy with what they do for her. but omgggg i saw that apparently that girl doxxed an innocent pregnant woman..</p></p>

      <p>It became this big social issue news that reached outside the kpop bubble
because people were questioning why this 13 year old little girl who&#x27;s not a
Chinese citizen and lives in canada has access to the Baidu user database it&#x27;s
like china&#x27;s Naver so almost everyone has a Baidu account and omg yea that lady
she doxxed being pregnant made things worse some fans were evil to her..



How it was reported in intl spaces made it seem like a girlboss moment but
wony&#x27;s cbar legit had to make a statement apologizing for fan behaviorðŸ˜“ I was
scared it would be like xiao zh*n where his fans got ao3 banned and he&#x27;s still
widely hated because of something his fans did not even him (the situations are
different obvs but talking about celebrities getting punished for their fans&#x27;
behavior) the baidu situation looks to have calmed down a little fortunately</p>
