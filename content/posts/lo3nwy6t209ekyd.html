      <p>its not they usually take 2 whole months to film the whole thing before it gets
aired on may i think they already started last month so thats why i was thinking
that it doesnt make sense that hanbin was mc when they were busy with cb</p>

      <p>The only reason I’m not going to get hopeful about this is because if other
anons arguments is that they might use multiple MCs because his schedule might
be too busy with zb1 stuff, how would that make Gunwook magically free too 😭
like if he’s free trust they are putting hb there and if he’s busy then I’d
assume the whole group is busy</p>
