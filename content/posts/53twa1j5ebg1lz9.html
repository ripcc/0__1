      <p>yj as a leader is crazyyyyyyy lmao def can&#x27;t see gv either. zh makes a lot of
sense considering he&#x27;d obviously be the oldest and was the g-group yhz leader so
it should be him (if he&#x27;s in the group) and if not him then some completely new
guy who&#x27;s one of the eldest. yuns3o was the k-group yhz leader so he probably
makes the most sense out of any of them but who knows if he&#x27;s even gonna be in
the yhz bg now</p>

      <p><p>its too wild to imagine that id actually give it to gyv if it came down to it LMAO zghs the obvious answer if he rllt ends up being in the group its him but i feel liek it would be so jarring for a new person to be leader cuz 1 new face.. who are you 2 zero experience as an idol. damn they might just have to hop on that no leader trend ghjghfdejfhb</p></p>
