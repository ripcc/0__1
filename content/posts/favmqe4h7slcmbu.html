      <p><p>NNGNFNCNFMDMFMD #nah blonde rky was truly legendary but I don&apos;t think it would be as tea now. his vibe changed since then like he doesn&apos;t look boyish at all anymore ðŸ˜¢ </p></p>

his face is kinda chubby now from the bulking so idt the blond would look as
good as it did back then when he was on ozempics</p>
