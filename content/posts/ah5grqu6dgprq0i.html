      <p><p>right and this is the case for like every group ever jfans always get these special events that everyone would die over ðŸ˜­ I think it&apos;s cuz kr is too much of home base + could receive scrutiny and every other fan is chopped liver </p></p>

      <p><p>They&apos;re actually easier and cheaper to do than real fansigns the expensive shit is the polaroids. I talked to some cfan who&apos;s been it&apos;s way easier to get in according to her and they do a bunchhhh of ppl so it makes sense it&apos;s basically longer hitouch </p></p>

      <p><p>sorta kinda? if you win through the codes the info is under ur name but sometimes cfans straight up buy the slots off ppl or bot it? im not sure theres some fish app they keep talking ab on there that i havent been able to figure out. but a lot of them have to pretend theyre someone else and it works if everyones ea like for ex ur not getting away with it if ur a diff race lol. i see a lot of fancall fails on xhs where they get kicked out in the waiting room whatever it is its similar to that where the info isnt under ur name i would do more research but translations get wonky af ðŸ˜­ </p></p>

      <p>those are sold too but apparently wk1 is very strict about checking verification
so it&#x27;s hard to get in as a foreigner unless you&#x27;re studying abroad or live in
korea but there are a lot of czrs prerecording reviews on xhs and they might
have tips</p>
