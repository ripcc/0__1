i was surprised that he renewed his contract w them bc i always got the vibe
that everyone else had a really solid bond and they all had their own cliques or
besties with within the group, and he&#x27;s not in any of those cliques and doesn&#x27;t
seem to be close to any of them at all (apart from maybe sy but its his job as
the leader to kind of take care of everyone)</p>
