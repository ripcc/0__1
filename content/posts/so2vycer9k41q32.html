This was the moment I knew it was time to unstan. Like‚Ä¶ what kind of marketing
is that? üò≠ you finally have a survival show group closest to the hype the
produce groups ha, they just debuted, and instead of focusing on promoting the
full group and pushing the song everywhere to go for that potential high chart
(especially when Korean GP had an hyper focus on the idol market because of IVE
and New Jeans comeback), you‚Äôre making shipping the main promotional strategy?
That should be something the fanbase naturally does, not the company. I still
find it laughable they turned the debut into a fanfiction starter pack.</p>

      <p>Its kinda sad how the groups golden debut time will only be rememberd by non
fans as a queerbait group and not high quality music/ choreo (IM SORRY I LOVE
YINTS BUT IT HAS TO BE SAID, WHY THE FUCK DID WE NOT GET A ENERGETIC 2.0 )</p>

      <p>this criticism applies to pretty much every jb1 era BUT debut era like debut era
was the only era where jb1 were universally accepted as having a really good
line up and really good music that&#x27;s how I got into them (it&#x27;s personal
preference ig but I prefer in bloom wayyyyy over energetic) but anyways don&#x27;t
ruin the only good times that we had with them the only era where we got good
ot9 vids mixed with funny and talent stuff and they went on radios and omg I&#x27;m
starting to shed a tear</p>

      <p>wki&#x27;s biggest mistake was making it so obvious abt which member they want to
push. solo sched shouldve only started in the 2nd comeback and crush should
never be the title track, at least not after in bloom. and then you have
sshibalgate on top of everything. things just got messier ever since</p>
