      <p>i say with zero intent to sound bitchy but genuinely why are you guys mad that
they highlighted jaobin like they were in the pannel and the most popular faces
for the audience I would actually blame wk1 for starving zeroses for so long abt
dorm content bc i expected it to Not be a balance like we should get that on
their own YouTube channel, not a variety show</p>

      <p>Different anon but you’re right queef. Ofc we expected them to highlight jaobin
a bit more because they were on the panel and had to talk about the video too so
ofc they would show more of them but it’s the fact that we barely saw any of the
other members. And this company has purposely never done any dorm content or any
personal daily life content and so the moment they post articles teasing that
it’s the first time showing it ever and making big hype for it you think they’d
actually show a decent amount of dorm life for each dorm. But instead the other
4 seemed like they were used to just make jw look good in his nice apartment
with his ghost manager.</p>
