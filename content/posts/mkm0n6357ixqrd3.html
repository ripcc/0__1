      <p>I think it’s because jaobin are never paired up in official content so more than
copium I’d describe it as “resentment” towards other ships that the company
pushes.. but it’s not m*ttbin’s fault if w*1 refuses to capitalize on jaobin
(those would be the easiest money they could make tho)</p>
