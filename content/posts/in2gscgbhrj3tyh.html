      <p>Although if I were a cr*sin I would be calling the police right now....one of
the head admins (and the most notorious one) is in Japan right now and I
wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if she&#x27;s fled with her monies and the rest are all on
their way out. They shut down the r*sin shop also and everything&#x27;s stuck in
limbo and the r*sins are still trying to wrangle out details and ledgers.
They&#x27;re giving them too much time to pull their funds and flee the country. Once
they pull funds all that&#x27;s left is to nuke their accs and then it&#x27;s gonna be
difficult to get their monies back.</p>

      <p>Wait lol this reminded me of something a while ago when people were complaining
about them doing something fishy with money but Iâ€™m not sure of the whole story
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­yeah if they had access to all that money plus all the fundraising they
would have been doing for upcoming projects and his birthday and they dip thatâ€™s
not going to look good at all especially for a big bar like that</p>

      <p>Jaos Cbar orders big amounts for Jaos magazines and then ends up canceling them
(according to The17 cfans). I was oringaly not believing them but now that
everything about the old staff is getting exposed.... It does looks like those
things were true</p>

      <p>iirc the magazines themselves confirmed the numbers after 24 hours and the cbar
posted receipts so idk but it&#x27;s still sus ðŸ¤” 8stars aren&#x27;t too reliable because
they also said olay nullified jao&#x27;s contract after 1 month and I was like ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€
until olay posted his cny greeting video weeks later so that was disappointing I
wanted drama ngl but cbar definitely had a problem with shipping fan orders I&#x27;m
friends with someone who ordered jao&#x27;s l&#x27;officiel cover last year from them
through a go and they ghosted the go admins for months and when they finally
replied they said the warehouse staff had lost the mags because they had been in
there for too long? lmao anyway they found the mags in the end and my friend&#x27;s
order finally arrived like last week but the cbar admins kinda scammed her
because they told her at the beginning that they&#x27;d send the mags to korea and
then ship them to the go admin&#x27;s country so everyone who ordered the mags had to
pay for the korea shipment which ended up not happening because as I said the
cbar ghosted them for months and then the issue with the warehouse happened and
the cbar refused to refund lol my friend told me it wasn&#x27;t much but it still
sucks you know? but yeah it took them over a year to ship the mags and I was
told those 3 problematic admins were in charge of that process so yeah I&#x27;m glad
they are gone I hope cr0sins sue them</p>
