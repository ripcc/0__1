      <p>rik himself doesnt seem want to utilize his own popularity sjfhdjsjdjdj his
tiktoks and instagram posts usually got the most engagement out of the members
but he stopped posting non-promotional solo tiktok after that whole bite me
ordeal i think? which is a shame and i gen cant tell why he doesnt post on insta
often. if only rik could be more active, his popularity wouldnt just stuck among
the casuals but could also strenghten his core fandom (which has been weaken,
well, due to his inactivity and dont bullshit me with company ban because the
members themselves have expressed plenty of times that theyre free to film
tiktok themselves)



i started liking him when he said he loves journaling in his PR video and his
duality was what made me choose him as my onepick during boys planet but even
until he has lost interest in journaling, we literally never seen him doing
that. the company didnt want to promote him and he also didnt promote himself so
this whole situation is just upsetting tbh with all those "what ifs".



i know he has this certain image he is trying to pursue but as a rookie, you
need to put effort yourself (outside of the company's push) to raise your
popularity which something that rik doesnt seem to be interested to be doing:(
like if your company doesnt promote you shouldnt you be doing something to
promote yourself:( how unfortunate</p>

      <p><p>his way of doing things is smth else but i wonder if it would feel any diff if there was proper promotion ðŸ¤” no matter how lazy and bummy i think he is idt he hates being an idol you can rlly see his ambition at times. i thought it was cute he specifically mentioned fancalls and fansigns in the anniv vid as his way of expressing and receiving fan love + the way he was super lit at kcon la hes just meant for the oldstyle idol life ig. </p><p></p><p>yea i think the bite me hate rlly got to him it was severe zang and idk what goes through his head but he seems settled with his position + hes not one of those tweaky members where the infandom hate would whip him into shape immediately. I just hope he changes smth up soon he rlly dont wanna fill the gaps wkn has for promotion GET UR FATASS UPPPPPPPP</p></p>

      <p>u can tell he genuinely likes performing and being in a concert setting everyone
knows hes not much of an initiator when it comes to social stuff like hes rarely
the one to make the plans or text first and all his friendships seem to be
initiated by the other person so that personality just naturally bleeds into the
idol stuff along with the fact that hes a perfectionist and does things slowly



he does get super obsessed and passionate about certain things for like a period
of time tho like right now its working out, a while ago it was buying a shit ton
of contacts, for a minute he was trying to have a more funny image in the group,
hes lowkey fixated on acting right now too, lets hope he gets obsessed with
social media some dayðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>no doubt that he is very passionate in performing, i remember he said he likes
composing songs and he has showed his self-composed song during livestream too
but like what is idol without parasocial shit, communicating fans is literally
one of idol's jobs so if he does want to be an idol in long run, he cannot keep
doing this esp after he redebuts (if he does), he will have to restart his
career from 0 and him only appearing on social media once in a blue moon is only
gonna hurt his idol career:( im a fan so i really want him to succeed, i hope he
can consider his fans' concerns regarding this. im not asking him to be a 24/7
yapper like gyu but pls at least utilize the paid platform well (ik a lot of
ryangis have the same concern too but we dont say much compared to those schizo
screaming about company ban ones)</p>

      <p><p>He showed a self composed song besides that garbage one with gyv? Bumba I need to hear it and yes I agree he needs to do better with communication he doesn&apos;t have the luxury to skimp on it. zbwon as a group are low on content and if he redebuts he&apos;s starting from scratch I hope he saw the rukidan frustration like we&apos;ll be taking the twice a week messages thank you </p></p>
