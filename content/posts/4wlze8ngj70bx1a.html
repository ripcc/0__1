      <p>idk if anybody here gaf abt big kfan business but just wanted to dump cuz its
acc embarrassing.

 * kiki (jws biggest kr acc) didnt leave at the peak of the scandal but didnt
   update anything for blue era so shes been ia for a month now

 * balloon was bullied off last year and dal (rks remaining 10k+ kfan acc) last
   twt was 2 weeks ago n the other one (waf) has p infrequent activity n was
   getting shat on by shityangis for begging rk not to bulk up.

 * someone alr sent that hit twt of a ruk1dan crashing out over rks lack of msgs
   n bad photocards n the qrts were filled w tired ruk1dans saying this is why
   hes losing his core kfans

 * but whats even funnier is that a few days before the ruk1dan crashout kr jwg
   fans were also crashing out bc of his pc inactivity so he had to sweettalk
   them w cringe petnames to calm them down¬†
   
   
   
   seems like both rk n jw kfans r so fed up w both of their negligences. only
   their boymom ifans are still crying abt bans while the kside makes fun of
   them. i support women getting out of toxic rships üòç</p>
