      <p>itâ€™s gonna be funny as fuck if they make him pretend to have lived there tho
meanwhile itâ€™ll most likely LITERALLY be the first time heâ€™s stepped foot in
that placeâ€¦. i lowkey want it to happen for the laughs. i know him not living
with them is an open secret atp but i do feel like theyâ€™re gonna get whacked if
itâ€™s admitted to idkkkkkkkk ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ or maybe we can hope itâ€™s only jw that gets
lashings since itâ€™s clearly not the restâ€™s problem</p>
