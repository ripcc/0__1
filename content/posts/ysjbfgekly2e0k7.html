      <p>honestly looking at the rumors of what his potential role is, i&#x27;d actually say
its a pretty good fit for him (a younger taiwanese man who is bf with one of the
main female leads) especially since when he speaks mandarin, it&#x27;s similar to the
tw dialect. it&#x27;s interesting to see a news exclusive about it now (not sure how
normal it is) cause it looks like the drama is supposed to come out in sept but
i also can imagine its to drum up excitement....lowk i hope he gets to actually
sing on the ost cause that would make sense (similar to the xtx sb yj cameo)
