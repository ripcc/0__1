      <p>the c-centeo just doesn&#x27;t seen as talented as ha0 and based on the 2 week old
gua which is basically confirmed now, it doesn&#x27;t sound like gvwoo is all that
either. I hope there&#x27;s proof of vehr1vehrv smoking too. The only thing that is
very wtf is yoomeki being pushed.</p>

      <p>not even being biased most of the popular ppl rn are not talented at least with
singing like the vryvry member wei member sngwon c center etc cannot sing at all
and are average dancer and rappers at best we don&#x27;t know the k center skills yet
but the only who can sing is the hyeop guy the yumki guy is a professional
dancer and seems very popular in jtwt most of the comments under the signal song
are about him so he might also become popular</p>
