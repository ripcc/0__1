      <p>crying bc i just went on one of those p*nnchoa posts about this n*t w*sh scandal
and there was a screenshot of a korean tweet in there that said they should add
my*ng j*ehyun and s*ng h*nbin into w*sh NOW WHY IS HB IN IT but also i find it
funny bc everyone here seems to think that hb&#x27;s boring (not me hehe) and yet
this person is saying to add him to the group to make it better (though i
understand that apparently his humour/personality resonates better with the
korean audience).... how bad are w*sh omg</p>

reason gw&amp;hb will keep talking and asking questions ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p><p>Like there&apos;s a huuuge difference WISH ARE BOTS THEY DONT EVEN WANNA SPEAK WHEN SPOKEN TO they have one worded answers and ruin the vibe.. hbn might not be funny but he doesn&apos;t need to be if he has convo skills. they can only function in their own bubble of content which relies on it&apos;s uniqueness if they ever had a zbtv they&apos;d be pulling negative views </p></p>

      <p>He won&#x27;t be the funniest person in the room, but he&#x27;s not that bad, he&#x27;s often
unintentionally funny, I&#x27;m very entertained watching him</p>
