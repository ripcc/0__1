      <p>I can&#x27;t help but worry abt Hanbin because unlike KD he can&#x27;t speak English
fluently.



How is he going to communicate with the non-Korean participators? ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>If it was just korean season I&#x27;d be so hyped but honestly I dont know what to
expect from swf fans among which are people who dont care about kpop at all.

I&#x27;m afraid they could be very harsh if they are not satisfied with something</p>
