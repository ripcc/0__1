      <p>bruhh u no that&#x27;s never gonna happen to the dear cj prince, I mean not for
nothing, as we look back at the last 2 years, for those who don&#x27;t think hb has
been extremely privileged from the v beginning and positioned to be their new
golden child is truly just kidding themselves and his akagaes thinking him not
being able to post everyday is mistreatment when he&#x27;s virtually number 1 across
all socials, and you see him every week cause mca will always be prioritized
compared to inki and mucore (although who knows maybe gyu will have that
privilege compared to yj who we have barely seen as mc). like this is facts that
solo activities related to cj have mostly been given to one individual, and like
good for him, but like this, coupled with the fact he is pretty much the only
one posting on some of the socials (like when was the last time we saw a rk or
zh on x that wasn&#x27;t mandatory) is also what contributes to why no one ever takes
his mistreatment seriously.</p>

      <p>Ok I agree with loads of things however the posting (aside from x) is a lot of
the same members and the thing about music shows is never going to go in yjs
favour or gv because they mc on a weekend.</p>
