      <p>they have the best chinese marketing right now whoever's behind it is so
internet savvy i'm jealous on the other hand w1 is middle aged and 10 years
behind all our douyin style tiktoks are either from chinese members or from fans
telling members to do something😒 i hate it when groups who don't really gaf
about their chinese fans (enh4 is the worst offender) get so much clout and the
image of caring for their cfans for doing douyin trends that were obviously
planned by staff but zbwon have to go extra viral and work harder for the same
clout without staff telling them what to do</p>
