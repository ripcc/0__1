      <p>Kar!na being a conservative is soooo funny to me. First off, the people denying
it are stupid af; I do research and my supervisor is from South Korea pursuing a
PhD in political science and he told me how huge and well known it is not to
wear colors signifying allegiance when it comes close to an election. Also, it’s
a very very important election coming out of a huge political event (plus a
majority of South Koreans vote in elections regardless). Her deciding to use
that pic, with those colors, with that number and that emoji isn’t a
coincidence. Ik not all Catholics are conservative but I wouldn’t be surprised
if she falls into the conservative-leaning ones. Maybe now people will discuss
all her plastic surgery openly lol anyways screw the right-wing populist party
(but I do have bad news - my supervisor says he has a feeling a moderate or
someone leaning right would win; hugely influenced by gender divide being
weaponized and in alignment with reinforcing conglomerate interest/mirroring
Trump’s “comeback”). It’s so bad he’s told me (because he is gay) that he
doesn’t want to return to Korea and wants to stay in the U.S. due to his
persecution (and that says A LOT). Much of south Korea’s diplomatic, financial
system, and societal structure fundamentally derived from 60s/70s era America -
that’s also why there’s so much tension and why it’s so hard to live there,
because the homogenous population + traditional cultural values are at constant
odds with the US’ values. I could yap about the politics of it forever lol but
Karina isn’t dumb, she did it on purpose, and international fans are
misunderstanding the magnitude of it; everyone knows better. And if they somehow
don’t, then they are dumber than a rock and still deserve pushback. It isn’t
like forgetting a small regional mayor election, it’s quiet literally like
wearing a M-A-G-A hat last year on your insta a week before the election.</p>
