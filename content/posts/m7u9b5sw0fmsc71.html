      <p>is there any other new/recent zbwon tea or have we exhausted it all? the mt gf
thing made me hungry for me and i was already craving lmaoooooooo. surely
someone&#x27;s spotted them out and about doing shit or they&#x27;re more lax now that
they&#x27;re doing fuck all 😭



but on the topic of mt, a few days ago i saw a screenshot on the korean side
(lost the tweet soz) that was someone on his plus chat live with the cat
basically commenting about how mt&#x27;s disappointing them and when i saw that i
thought it was solely about him getting a cat since it feels like he now has
time to do that as zbwon are clearly slowing down and who knows what his
post-zbwon career will be but now that i think about it maybe the fan knew or
could even just feel he got a gf and was looking after the cat with her 🤔</p>
