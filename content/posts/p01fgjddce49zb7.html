      <p>I canâ€™t get over how mediocre ge0nwoo wasâ€¦ likeâ€¦ yeah the rumors gotta be true
about favoritism. The lack of core strength shows through his posture and heâ€™s a
little bit stiff. Looks friendly tho Iâ€™ll give him that. Heâ€™s a former CUBE
trainee too (just like h@nbin) so not only does he have those industry ties with
mnet through being a wakeone trainee but also a cube one (iykyk).</p>

      <p>I hope anon knows that this trainee is actually not a Wkone trainee ðŸ˜­ The
rumors started because of some post on IG but the said trainee is said to be 18
years old back in 2024, that guy is at least 20 years old (born in 2003).
Timeline wise it doesnt add up. The actual Wkone trainee is that S4nghyun guy
and as a reminder, just bcs he was a trainee in C0be doesnt mean that the staff
from C0be who work at Wkone know the trainees they had in the company 5+ years
ago ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Iykyk i guess ðŸ¤ª</p>
