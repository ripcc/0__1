      <p>FYI Try not to share it too much bc if they start seeing what they say on x or
think they got exposed theyll move to another gallery nd make the name even
harder to find nd a big misconception is that all fans knows about these
galleries but its not true, most of these galleries are from a small group like
normal fans dont know these galleries even exists bc these galleries are mostly
for ranting their displeasure and even likes but just in a safe place away from
the public so haters and antis wont jump on it which i think is completely
healthy bc its basically us here</p>

      <p>when the dorm teaser was out, they&#x27;re like &quot;so that person(uncl) is gonna act
like he&#x27;s living together with 4 and 6?&quot; LOL theyre deadass calling uncl &quot;ê·¸ë¶„&quot;
like hes some voldemort. anw literally everyone knows that uncl doesnt live
together with the rest but of course his fans tryna convince themselves that hes
part of the family



4,6=members in age order</p>
