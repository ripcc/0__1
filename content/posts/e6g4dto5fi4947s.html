      <p>ok i know hes not that fat but he rly needs to lose weight... maybe he thought
gaining weight would make his head more proportional to his body but it looked
way more proportional when he was skinny like u should embrace ur big head king
in some cultures it means ur smart... he gains weight in his face and it makes
his head look bigger so whats the point ugh</p>
