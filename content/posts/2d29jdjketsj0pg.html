      <p>Sorry anon and queef but Iâ€™m pretty sure there was already a big rumour that the
trainees were already moving into the dorms and that it was definitely starting
to be released by mid this year. I think they could definitely have two shows
going on at similar times considering they arenâ€™t going for the same market.</p>
