      <p>went on the account to see if they&#x27;d said anything else and all the diehard rap
listener tweets with &quot;mt slayyyyyyy&quot; dashed in is killing me so bad like they&#x27;re
not slicksdkndskfmsdf good they chilled out on that bc they&#x27;d probably be
spotted if they continued. whenever i hear about mt&#x27;s friends i remember that
one tr stan who went to school with rk and how he didn&#x27;t wanna join their kpop
dance group lmao that&#x27;s always been so funny to me</p>
