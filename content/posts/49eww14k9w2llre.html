      <p>idk if u play sswo but if u do i wanted to know if u also have this problem bc
it's so annoying. sooooooo often when i play it won't even let me on bc it says
i need to connect to the internet meanwhile my wifi is otherwise perfectly fine
on my phone or laptop üò≠ usually when it happens the app will eventually work
after a while but as of now i've been trying to play for like 20 mins,
repeatedly closing and restarting the app and that message keeps popping up. if
it's some problem with my phone (which i doubt) then eh but if it's a problem
with the app why tf won't they fix it and why does no one else seem to complain
about it i'm maddddddddd</p>
