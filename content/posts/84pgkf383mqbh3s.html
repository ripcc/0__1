      <p>I can see anon was an idiot getting the radiation from yhz akgaes. Jf broken up
with cj years ago, their break up was messy ggd and vrvr was greatly impacted.
They joined hands with kko for distribution etc, but cj got soft spot for them
because b4 wnn1 exist, jf and their kids (vxx, sjeong, mina) was the one bring
them money and clouts for pd101. And vrvr was basically birthed by cj when jf
was at their peak. If anything, wke1 most likely the one beefing with jf</p>
