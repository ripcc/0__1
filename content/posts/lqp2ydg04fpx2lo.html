      <p>wk1 not clarifying the real reason and making hrbz not come on pc (well nothing
new for rk lol) for almost two days made people lose their minds like i get the
frustration even tho i dont agree with the hate on the members, and then that
pic dropped and zrs started saying wk1 restricted the members from acknowledging
hrbz but like why would they do that it makes no sense ðŸ˜­ also set hb up big
time in that interview and taiwanese media being messy as hell too like the
whole group should&#x27;ve never attended this event in the first place half the
stadium was empty</p>
