      <p>It looks like Hb went with Fendi and Gucci dropped Jw because of that ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ This
doesnt look good for Jw because everybody felt like he was pushed along for the
Gucci thing but now it really looks like that was the case. Jw appeared with no
Gucci sponsorship TWICE to the airport and both times Hb was wearing Fendi. I
know that Zh has something going on with Gucci China. I wonder why they wont
dress him for Airport appearances tho. Im saying Gucci China because if he was
with Gucci Korea he would have gotten dressed everytime the other two do too or
attended the events in Korea. I also wonder why luxury brands dont want him more
in Korea. He is always getting the Chinese version of the brands. We get tvat he
is Chinese but he is still a Kpop Idol?? Dior seems to have dropped Yj and thats
why he is stuck with Barrie and thats about it I guess when it comes to
sponsorships within the group. I know that Gv got some Prada bag as a gift and
stuff, I wonder why they wont dress him even tho they send him Pr.</p>

      <p>Chanel here - I agree I donâ€™t think him appearing with fendi at the airport is a
sign heâ€™s no longer working with Gucci. Especially since heâ€™s not a BA so
thereâ€™s no restrictions on him working with other brands too, my guess is heâ€™s
just accepting more sponsorships now. I wonâ€™t comment on the jw thing much
because those that have been here a while know my opinion on what went on down
there, but still hb and jw did have some Gucci stuff on them today e.g hbs Gucci
passport holder and jw Gucci bag. Though itâ€™s true jws fit wasnâ€™t sponsored
since his jacket is from rocawear. In terms of zh only working with china
branches of a brand, in my honest opinion I donâ€™t think that has anything to do
with him personally or with brands not wanting him because heâ€™s popular and
brings good visibility. I think itâ€™s more to do with his management (this is
just my opinion). Also Yujin and barrie isnâ€™t anything new either I think he
went to one of their events way before he did anything with Dior.</p>
