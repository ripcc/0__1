      <p>Pretty sure people already speculated Worksop was already casted and they were
just promoting that for hype. I donâ€™t even know where people are getting Workdol
from because itâ€™s all public things and someone would have spotted him but no
oneâ€™s said anything seemingly even his ssngs who usually know the tea havenâ€™t
hinted at anything either making me think itâ€™s an internal thing.</p>

      <p>MC role but when shuhua stepped down the last guest was haewon and she became mc
so when haewon stepped down this time the last guest was eunch so it could b her
?? but the kr articles about workdol never mentioned her they put jao on the
forefront for potential mcs so i understand there&#x27;s gonna be expectations but
workdol is veryyyy time consuming and exhausting</p>
