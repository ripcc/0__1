      <p>0s are so annoying, fake mistreatment defender all day. the number of people in
my tl demanding why wke1 didn&#x27;t post zgh&#x27;s 0focus, do these people know today he
attended the dinner, the main event hasn&#x27;t even happened yet. we know this
company is incompetent, but at least start complaining after the main event.
this is why this company became even more daring, 0s just love to complain but
don&#x27;t know when and where</p>
