      <p>i swaer i aint shitting on them but i noticed most of them are rich but money is
all they have, they don&#x27;t really have any real irl friends and if they do have
they&#x27;re all fake for clout like they can&#x27;t make genuine relationship irl
themselves so they have to buy it via fancalls yk</p>
