      <p><p>I rlly have to wonder if he has a brain parasite LIKE WHY DOES HE ACT LIKE THIS I finally got around to watching the new anniv vid and he just talks so much ab love for the group and fans and the crazy thing is I believe him hes just so unaware of how unhuman and offputting he is like ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.. alright bro just go home </p></p>

      <p>my hatred for him always blinded me but tbh i do believe he is SOMEWHAT
neurodivergent. i dont think ive seen an idol so unaware of social cues before.
i dont think hes even an attention seeker when he does weird dances i think he
just does it off a impulse. like the angdkjeong thing i feel he doesnt think
about reprucussions as easily. might sound like im coddling a grown man but just
my observation</p>

      <p><p>hes genuinely puzzling at times i rmbr someone did a longgg analysis on him back on cc cuz theyve known and liked him for yrs and they cooked smth is not right up there.. but idt it can be heavily attributed like that tho. hes def aware of his actions and the repercussions the way he acted most of last yr was accordingly but recently he just doesnt seem to gaf anymore and seems very last ditch effort desperate since the climate arounds him calmed down and theyre ending soon but i think he does feel positibe towards the group and fans. hes just entitled thats why theres no apology thats why he feels no guilt thats why he doesnt mind using the members thats why gets the resources thats why he feels like the fans are also there for him (outside of his own) ugh lemme not go on a tangent but hes.. special</p></p>

      <p>i always have to remind myself that he's been through like 2 lawsuits, one
company basically depriving his group of food and living costs and the other
company's ceo most likely sexually assaulting him so that would've fucked anyone
up but idk üò≠ maybe bc he's been through all that and can clearly tell that this
is the end of his idol career he dgaf but he SHOULD gaf, his members certainly
do since this is their first rodeo - or at least most of them gaf, i assume</p>

      <p><p>it would like i dont doubt hes been through some serious shit and it changed him but why does he act like someone with no ambition refusing to genuinely contribute to the group..? like anyone else in his circumstances would be doing backflips for this opportunity but hes very self oriented in the worst way possible. even if this isnt his first time being an idol its his first time being a popular one youd think he would be even more ambitious than the rest but hes not</p></p>
