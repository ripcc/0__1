      <p>It‚Äôs not a recent thing I think anon is only noticing it now lol they‚Äôve been
pushing them HARDDD since like melpo era üò≠



You know companies nowadays have a favourite fanservice ship they love to push
extra hard and it‚Äôs clear that‚Äôs geonmaet for wk1 + it‚Äôs easy for them to push
them bc geonmaet themselves love playing it up and whoring out for the cameras

      <p><p>okay now we&apos;re just making things up.... they&apos;re gonna push a ship where they don&apos;t even promote them individually right.. HFJJFJFJJFJDJJF like idk if yall know what a push is but the only things that would come out ab them would be clips from behind the scenes if they were gonna push them they&apos;d send them to stuff but that&apos;s just how they are as ppl SORRY THEY ACT LIKE MEXICANS U DONT KNOW BALL and wow zroses have being trying too hard to make mattwook seem like a government planted ship when literally NOBODY ANF I MEAN NOBODY GAVE A SINGLE FUCK TILL NOW üò≠ now they get some intltwt engagements and it&apos;s a push like sorry they were getting 0 clicks and likes for what they were doing in melpo why would wkn invest in that ‚úåÔ∏è</p></p>

      <p>lol i saw a few very new zbwon stans say they have the best chemistry in the
group and it&#x27;s their fav ship so it&#x27;s working i guess since all the most recent
content is very geonmatt heavy. matt has changed ships so many times like i
remember jw x mthw was the 2nd biggest ship at debut after ha0bin</p>

      <p><p>Right.. so exactly what I meant nobody noticed till it got popular üò≠ because their 2023 zepisodes used to be just as crazy it&apos;s just that no one cared. like what&apos;s &quot;working&quot; JFJNFNDNDMDM THIS ISNT NEW I dont think anyone&apos;s comprehending what I&apos;m trynna say. I&apos;ve been a mattwook 6x PHD holder for ages now nobody started calling them pushed till recently so we need to drop this before I get mega irked #UNQUALIFIED</p></p>
