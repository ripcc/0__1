      <p>maybe I just don&#x27;t keep up with enough groups but I swear we dont actually see
kpop idols dorms that much I think only bp showed their house (?) or something
and btß and ßvt only showed their dorms like one or twice in 10 years im not
aware of any other groups tea</p>

      <p><p>ur right its less common for new groups but its vital for svs groups its the one of the only ways fans can see them as a group and shed the competitive image. like bonding moments are so important to the fd atmosphere they didnt get yrs of training w eo compared to other groups</p></p>

      <p>If you&#x27;re from the same company a lot of dorms are re used 😭😭 Duck i forgot
which company but their dorm was used for 3 gens and a tweet went viral on kside
2 months ago calling out the company for being cheap 😭😭😭 So maybe that&#x27;s why
too the company don&#x27;t want to self expose how cheap they are</p>
