      <p>ok so i skimmed through 2 eps of the manager show to see what tea was so first
of all the show always has 2 members from the group along with the cast react to
the stuff recorded. and out of the 1 hour and 30 mins only 30 mins or so
actually shows the idol group while the rest is them recording some khia cast
member from the show. idek what was going on at the end tbh but the idol group
invited is not shown at all after the first 30 mins except the 2 members who
were reacting are forced to laugh at whatevers happening for the rest of hour
(shit was not funny AT ALL)



1) so i watched lassarfims. in their ep they dont show their dorm at all and it
starts directly at the hype building. they only show their practices and stuff.
but since our article said we will see their dorm so im guessing our ep wont be
like theirs



2) in tw$ episode they start at the group waking up at their dorm and then
getting ready to go to some concert. they show who the roomates are, their room
arrangements and decorations and also where the manager lives</p>

      <p>yes there are subs and yes it will include half dorm and half company because
they are supposed to show us how managers handle things through out the day but
they dont really show a lot of authenticity in the dorm space tbh like they were
hardly there they dipped after having breakfast and yea they showed their rooms
and all but it was like we just woke up here rn guysss when it&#x27;s obvious they&#x27;d
already been up and maybe the twÃŸ guys have no personality but they all only had
like 2 or 3 things in their rooms and bed so it would be really easy to fake
something like that for uncle so I think we&#x27;re good</p>

      <p>i remember watching part of the triple ess episode and it was like 10 minutes of
showing their living spaces, doing homework and how they order food. kinda
interesting since it&#x27;s separated into 3 units + some members don&#x27;t dorm so they
showed them arriving in a taxi at the salon. anyways fans should definitely
lower their expectations of dorm content but it&#x27;ll be nice to see what type of
place they live in</p>
