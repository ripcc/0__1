      <p>her reactions were crazy bcs it took them over 3 minutes to guess the song title
with guessing feel it pop feel that pop and everything BUT feel the pop and she
wanted to WIN. she&#x27;s is competitive, not dating anyone. also ftp was most likely
played bcz of na pd and he is the last person to want to even attempt to expose
yj for anything, she&#x27;s like a daughter to him</p>
