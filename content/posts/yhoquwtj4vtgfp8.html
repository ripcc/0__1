      <p>ok lowkey im not the best person to be explaining their lore bc my memory’s
genuinely so bad and there’s just So Much so if you’re really THAT curious you
can go through this neo and her twt (this post in particular mentions some
pivotal moments) she gets pretty tinhatty but that’s to be expected plus imo
she’s able to view things objectively rather than just through s**gyu-tinted
glasses and she acknowledges when she’s being “delulu”



but from the top of my head some recent things to happen are

 * TH teased BG by saying that P*nic (BG’s solo song) wouldn’t have been
   released if it weren’t for SB and BG agreed by saying that it’s kinda true
   since he started working on it partially due to the feelings he felt during
   SB’s hiatus

 * a week into SB’s hiatus BG was basically full on sobbing on a live after
   speaking about how much he misses SB while listening to a song called “home”
   which is SB’s nickname from m*as

 * BG calling the time he was separate from SB “a cold time in his life” and
   saying he slept in SB’s bed while he was gone

 * honestly the entirety of BG’s behavior during SB’s hiatus 😭

 * BG called SB his “life companion” (인생의 동반자) which is what people call their
   spouse

 * SB’s 2024 bday message to BG was “i like that i become childish and simple
   when im with you” a direct reference to a love song that he later recommended
   to m*as

 * BG’s bday message to SB was “hyung, you’re my life’s greatest blessing”

 * they both have repeatedly expressed wanting to run a cafe together and
   adopting a dog in the future

most of what i listed is from BG bc he’s the more loud and outwardly obvious one
out of the two and like i said my memory’s not all that great but yeah idk if
i’d say they’re exactly Dating at this point but they at very least have
Something going on which is so funny bc SB solos absolutely hateeeee BG and vice
versa LOL</p>
