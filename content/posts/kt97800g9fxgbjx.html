      <p>It&#x27;s actually nothing BIG and mostly speculation. That&#x27;s one of his friends (A
male friend, so don&#x27;t even try) birthdays. They know this because he was
following that friend on his IG. They are scary because that guy didn&#x27;t even
have his birthday on his profile or anything..</p>
