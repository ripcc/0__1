half a million views with 50k+ likes within a day, this is by far the best jb1&#x27;s
youtube show guesting engagement-wise. the salon drip reached 1m+ views in two
weeks and still got less likes than this one. a lot of comments are very
supportive towards jao too, i guess koreans love his durian lore sm. it even
peaked at #4 in youtube s.kor&#x27;s trending videos. too bad this wasnt released
during blue promotion period</p>

      <p>The jaej00ng friends episode trended in Korea Youtube at #7 even though
Jaej00ngs fandom is not as hardcore as popular as 5oobins. It more likely
depends on which shows they visit</p>
