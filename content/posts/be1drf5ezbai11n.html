      <p>so dk if you care abt wswf but some koreans are saying they like 2 as mc but
intl side says he&#x27;s lacking as mc because he doesn&#x27;t hype up the battles and
don&#x27;t tell the dancers to like back off when they get too close or break a rule
(?) i think which k$ng dan1el used to do and maybe its because the dancers are
like his seniors and he&#x27;s a bit shy or hesitant but yeah they&#x27;re basically
saying this is why you shouldn&#x27;t use junior mc&#x27;s lmaoo and that they miss dan1el
but like yk he&#x27;s also in the military sooo i&#x27;m sure if it wasn&#x27;t for that yeah
they prob would have kept him</p>

      <p>all of this is not said by the &quot;intl side&quot; it&#x27;s all just kng dniel fans and we
all know his fans were the original schizo subfandom also sorry it&#x27;s unclassy
for a man to get in between two women fighting</p>

      <p>bro kng dniel fans and allints were fighting like crazy few days ago cause dniel
fans started saying hnbin wasn&#x27;t a good mc unprovoked just cause he didn&#x27;t break
up a fight he isn&#x27;t even shy he was hyping up everyone the whole time he has no
business breaking up fights it&#x27;s not his job</p>

      <p>It’s actually funny they started this cuz in s1 kd was criticised for the same
thing when two dancers got really heated at eachother and he comes from a hiphop
bg where giving space is etiquette, hb comes from a whacking battle background
where it’s common for whacker to get psychical (not violent) and all up in
eachothers space. Lowkey they just mad because after ep1 there was hit/viral
tweets about hbn mcing and saying how they are glad it ain’t kd anymore</p>
