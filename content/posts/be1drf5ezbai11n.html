      <p>so dk if you care abt wswf but some koreans are saying they like 2 as mc but
intl side says he's lacking as mc because he doesn't hype up the battles and
don't tell the dancers to like back off when they get too close or break a rule
(?) i think which k$ng dan1el used to do and maybe its because the dancers are
like his seniors and he's a bit shy or hesitant but yeah they're basically
saying this is why you shouldn't use junior mc's lmaoo and that they miss dan1el
but like yk he's also in the military sooo i'm sure if it wasn't for that yeah
they prob would have kept him</p>

      <p>all of this is not said by the "intl side" it's all just kng dniel fans and we
all know his fans were the original schizo subfandom also sorry it's unclassy
for a man to get in between two women fighting</p>

      <p>bro kng dniel fans and allints were fighting like crazy few days ago cause dniel
fans started saying hnbin wasn't a good mc unprovoked just cause he didn't break
up a fight he isn't even shy he was hyping up everyone the whole time he has no
business breaking up fights it's not his job</p>

      <p>It‚Äôs actually funny they started this cuz in s1 kd was criticised for the same
thing when two dancers got really heated at eachother and he comes from a hiphop
bg where giving space is etiquette, hb comes from a whacking battle background
where it‚Äôs common for whacker to get psychical (not violent) and all up in
eachothers space. Lowkey they just mad because after ep1 there was hit/viral
tweets about hbn mcing and saying how they are glad it ain‚Äôt kd anymore</p>
