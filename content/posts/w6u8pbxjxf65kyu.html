      <p>&quot;nobody knows who tr is he will sink deeper to nugudom than the titanic&quot; mind
you tr went viral with 0 screentime during boys planet, debuted 6 with no
screentime and is the only one who has been going viral for talent rather than
memes lol his duet with Lee Mujin made more noise than Zb1&#x27;s last korean
comeback and he has a big dedicated Korean fandom don&#x27;t worry about him</p>
