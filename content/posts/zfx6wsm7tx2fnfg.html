      <p>Do you think there will be nwjeanz members who will come back to ad0r last
minute just like how that one fftyffty member did? Cause getting banned is
serious &amp; we might only hear from them at j@ejoong&#x27;s age</p>

      <p><p>I don&apos;t think any of the members would get decent treatment if they broke off and went back they sealed their fates being so public about everything. Also I heard the keena girl came back because she was the only member that wasn&apos;t from a rich family and she genuinely couldn&apos;t afford to be in that much debt</p></p>

Because everyone is expecting that and it&#x27;ll confirm Ad0r always wanted them
replaced story so now they have an excuse to lock them up. But I feel like Ad0r
wants to prove haters &#x27;wrong&#x27; hence why I think Ad0r might promote them, with
decent quality too because everyone is expecting them to do the bare minimum.</p>
