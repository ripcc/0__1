      <p>curious about chanel&#x27;s opinion about jao attending gcci26 cruise because from
last year she said it&#x27;s possible unc and janbin were invited and couldn&#x27;t attend
due to schedule conflicts (or more like agreeing akgaes/solos words) but it&#x27;s
less likely for jao to be invited and look at what happened now lol.</p>

time last year ao how the hell was Chanel supposed to know and she literally
said the same thing she said for woongsungz for hao when someone asked her about
it recently. Plus no one was even discussing jao at cruise last year that whole
convo started because woongsungz posted pics with those boxed that got sent out
as invites, so you must be thinking of something else anon.</p>
