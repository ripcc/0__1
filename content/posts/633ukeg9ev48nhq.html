      <p>When the show starts airing ik a lot of y’all will think Yumek!’s dancing is
somehow off (and wonder why because he’s a professional choreographer) but the
answer is the torso posture and the spine. I watched him and followed him since
Street Fighter and he can swing the FAWK out of his hips and arch that spine but
he arches so much that he compromises upright posture when he doesn’t intend too
and lacks rigidity for solid dance lines. He simultaneously looks rigid from the
arching and lacks details due to that rigidity. Also, I genuinely mean this with
no ill intent, but he’s short and the proportions of wide movements aren’t
always flattering on him and sometimes emphasize his size. It’s further
exacerbated because he proportionately has a shorter torso and shorter arms,
making things look more different. His footwork is insanely good tho.</p>

      <p>Reminds me of how kpop fans act like professional dancers are supposed to be the
epitome of amazing dancing. No it just means they got paid and made a career
with dance. Most choreographers I know are so unable to dance outside of their
preferred style and it’s so irritating when they can’t match the group</p>
