      <p>what did you think abt jnnie&#x27;s coachlla set? i saw a few praises last night but
i actually watched it this morning and it was very boring... i think she lacked
a lot energy almost like it was hard for her to stand still? idk and she was
barely singing. now i&#x27;m seeing similar opinions on twitter like it was boringgg</p>

      <p><p>superrrrr boring ik her performance game is weak as fuck but youd think shed try for coachella that she famously loves ðŸ˜­ also esp w the lsa rivalry but we know she cant gag herrrr ahaaaa. but this just shows that her musics still not out there singles are rlly the tea cuz i only knew mantra and like jnnie whereas i knew most of lsas set </p></p>
