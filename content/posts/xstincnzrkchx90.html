      <p>? Wait but if he did say that isn&#x27;t it more like he&#x27;s admitting pc attendance is
by his own choice and couldn&#x27;t come because he was busy? Which his kfans have
been saying all along but his i and c fans are the ones saying he&#x27;s on a ban
therefor can&#x27;t go on pc? So he&#x27;s mocking them instead rather than his k fans? I
hope it&#x27;s true so his i and c fans can finally shut the fuck up</p>

      <p>Oh so it&#x27;s true? Thank the LAWD because I love him and all but every time he&#x27;s
asked about it he beats around the bush that leads to his i and c fans tweaking
with these ban bullshit but seriously that riyangi opp is right with how anyone
can tell it&#x27;s all on him and his body language screams guilty. I still remember
the recent fancall where a c fan asked him to post pc and he was like mhmmm and
his i fans were crying saying &quot;see he wants to post but can&#x27;t say anything and
can only say mhmmm he&#x27;s so restricted &lt;/3&quot; and then two days later another c fan
asked him to wear a bright shirt the next fancall and he was like mhmmm but
didn&#x27;t wear it....ðŸ’€I really don&#x27;t understand how his i and c fans ignore all
these tell tale signs that he dgaf and says things just to shut them up...

Whatever I&#x27;m glad he finally owned up to it but no ones translating it so his i
and c fans still gonna tweak.... great... I was always on his k fans side</p>
