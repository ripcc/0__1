      <p>Sometimes I wonder if rk saw that riyangi opp acc bc why is he switching up for
the better lately ðŸ˜­ Their last tweet a week ago was about being depressed bc of
rk and how theyre afraid hes turning into their opp ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and in a week he came
to pc twice, pc live and now hes answering without giving any room for
schizyangis to twist his words into some wake1 purposely doesnt let him dye his
hair to erase him conspiracy and that was one thing they hated (me too) about rk
where he&#x27;d beat around the bush not giving clear answers. But now he&#x27;s like no
it&#x27;s actually me.
