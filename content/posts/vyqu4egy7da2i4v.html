      <p>Have you heard of the Wonyoung Sense magazine sales drama? Yujin global posted a
data of Kpop artists sales and Yujin is #15 or 16 and she&#x27;s the highest female
(of course #1 is our Haohao). Wonyoung&#x27;s fans are protesting because Sense sold
more but the sales don&#x27;t reflect since Sense has no ISSN. I guess it was already
pointed out even before the release that the magazine is kinda operating
illegally hence the attorney&#x27;s statement because it can also damage Wonyoung&#x27;s
brand</p>
