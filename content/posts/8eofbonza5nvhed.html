      <p>saw this in another mond but do you think jao has some kinda connection now with
an embc producer or smth because they’re kinda giving him a few gigs with that
dorm panelist then his drama cameo and now he’s narrating their travel show
considering it’s a korean broadcasting station so they’re a bit conservative and
all</p>

      <p>This is one of those rare cases where being a foreigner helped him get gigs. The
drama character is taiwanese so hiring a chinese/taiwanese person makes sense,
and the cast of the travel show went on a trip to china so it also makes sense
to have a chinese person do the narration. But I also think he might&#x27;ve gotten
close to an embc pd lol we&#x27;ll see. If they also give him a drama ost then I&#x27;ll
be convinced someone at embc likes him.</p>
