      <p>Doubt itâ€™s going to be their own bg tho, most those trainees are going to bp2
although it does make me wonder if they send some of their trainees to bp 2 (the
members companies) but not for the sake of making the svs group but just to give
them some exposure and clout in zb1s final months so they could possibly join a
future group with some sort of fanbase. Also I just realise most of bp2 will be
airing while zb1 is on tour</p>
