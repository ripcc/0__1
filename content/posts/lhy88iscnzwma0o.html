      <p>ppl seem to be theorising that nam j*woon is in this bg?????? which means he

      <p>Real talk tho his bsf who was also rumoured to be in tl (junwon) is debuting in
a different group so if he’s not in this group hes 100% in tl in my eyes because
why else would he be complete out of the public eye</p>
