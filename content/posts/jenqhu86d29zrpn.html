      <p>Now camping on Weibo and watching the cr0s1ns try attempt number 3175465 to
overthrow/take back control of their cbar cos they&#x27;ve had enough of the cbar
heads....let&#x27;s see if they succeed this time, I theorise the cbar heads has yh
staff in there but the r0s1ns have numbers on their end.</p>

      <p>Eeehh, yh is known for contacting cbars and coordinating events with them so
that the cbar can later relay accurate information to the fans but I don&#x27;t think
they actually manage any cbar. The heads of Rk&#x27;s old cbar were scammers and a
new cbar had to be created by other fans just last year, Yj&#x27;s current cbar
almost quit out of stress, and R*s1n Estrella (Zh&#x27;s third cbar) was created way
before he won bp. The identity of the 3 admins of Zh&#x27;s current cbar is public
knowledge and they&#x27;re just very stubborn fans with huge egos. If anyone wants
tea, their weibo user names are @持证发财 @奔奔喜欢吃榴莲 and @怪力少女梁春娇 But yeah, they need
to step down.</p>

      <p>The fandom would open new public applications and vote on them the other two
will probably have to be forced out though all cbars make money especially
popular idols&#x27; cbars and they won&#x27;t want to let go of that</p>

      <p>They finally forced the other 2 out LMAOO about time too but now it&#x27;s a slow
process of fandom discourse and probably some fighting to see who replaces them.
As someone who watches from the sidelines though anyone is better than the
previous admins and it&#x27;s good they&#x27;re getting this done before disbandment</p>
