      <p>i didnâ€™t watch so iâ€™m curious but how did they go about showing jwâ€™s place like
did they try and make it look like the same building or did they just randomly
show them going to his apartment/house like did they try make it look believable
or ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ bc ik damn well the others have never stepped foot in there which is
cracking me up</p>
