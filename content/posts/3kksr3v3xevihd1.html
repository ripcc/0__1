      <p>I mean wbk, this reminded me of bp where 2 trainees entered through highup ent
but after they ‘joined’ wk1 and turns out they were never in highup in the first
place but always under wk1. Idk if it’s for the same reason now but back then it
was because each company could only send 10 trainees so wk1 already had sent 10
but found the loophole by sending their other trainees under a different company</p>
