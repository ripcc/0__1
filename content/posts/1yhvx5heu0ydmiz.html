      <p>yeah i was so confused by all the posts saying the members arent allowed to post
about hb&#x27;s bday like where did y&#x27;all get that idea from... they probably just
texted him or told him in person they just didn&#x27;t think about posting for it lol</p>

      <p>&quot;Some members cant even post their own shit on x&quot; Please for the love of god
help yourself get out of this misery ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Your bias just doesnt want to post on
there, nobody is saying No to him ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Atp its a fact that most boy prefer
posting on Pchat because they also get paid for being active on there and thats
the cold hard truth. Kpop fans are never beating Parasocialism</p>
