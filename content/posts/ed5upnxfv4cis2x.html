      <p>honestly looking at the rumors of what his potential role is, i&#x27;d actually say
its a pretty good fit for him (a younger taiwanese man who is bf with one of the
main female leads) especially since when he speaks mandarin, it&#x27;s similar to the
tw dialect. it&#x27;s interesting to see a news exclusive about it now (not sure how
normal it is) cause it looks like the drama is supposed to come out in sept but
i also can imagine its to drum up excitement....lowk i hope he gets to actually
sing on the ost cause that would make sense (similar to the xtx sb yj cameo)

      <p>was it because of political tensions tho because the festival said they got all
legal permits a mainland china actor was in taiwan like a week ago a3spa was
also in taiwan iirc recently so i don’t think it was so much political as prob
wk1 rlly did just mess up their visas</p>

      <p>That’s for tourism. Everyone needs some type of working visa if you’re entering
a country to make money. I remember oh my grl? tried entering America to shoot
for their album and got turned away because they didn’t have a performance visa.
But the company lied and said it’s because customs thought they were sx workers.
Don’t know why they thought that’s a better pr statement than saying they messed
up the visa</p>
