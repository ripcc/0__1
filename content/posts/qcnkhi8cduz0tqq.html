      <p>I saw someone else say this but Iâ€™d like to know people opinions on this. They
said that the reason 0s and even solos and akgaes with ship him with anyone is
not because of a perceived image but because deep down most these people are gf
stans and will make a situation sexual/ romantic to self insert</p>

      <p><p>ðŸ¤” hmmmmm i see where ur going but i think its def the image thing that precedes that. gf stanning and shipping has always been intertwined but you only see this w idols who r dubbed the thotty members. like all those nasty mtt harem fans act liek that cuz they rlly think thats his vibe </p></p>

      <p>It&#x27;s because normal fans don&#x27;t take shipping seriously unlike the people who are
foaming at the mouth about &quot;monogamy&quot; because they&#x27;re THAT emotionally attached
and desperate to prove the validity of their ship</p>

      <p>I think thats the biggest thing for most Jaobin shippers. Go use the ship name
SoobJao or some shit for your Walmart version of Jaobin</p>
