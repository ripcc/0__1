      <p>i thought it was pretty obvious zgh and hbn have pretty complementary dance
styles (probably cause they dance together the most)...like if they were to
become an actual duo, i think they'd actually be pretty successful (from like a
performing standpoint). yj's dance style does remind me of hbn but i feel like
in this case it was a bit too tight if that makes sense, like amazing control
but i think it looks off when paired with zgh's more exaggerated style. i
actually thought that if zgh and yj did separate tt it would be better cause
individually i thought they did fine</p>
