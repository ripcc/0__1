      <p>i think conversations about selling power are more complicated than a single
sales #, unless there&#x27;s a big increase in popularity or they get on a better
magazine it&#x27;s hard to increase or even match first mag sales. forex th*8 is
going on figaro rn which is his first top7 chinese mag so i&#x27;m expecting higher
sales but any regular cover he goes on i wouldn&#x27;t. you could try to measure
endorsement sales too but that also depends on brand category and # of
endorsements. for zbwon another thing is rk&#x27;s mag was at the peak of his
popularity post running man when his supertopic checkins surpassed zh he had
like 30000+ and zh had 24000+ it was crazyy. i rlly felt rk might become the new
#1 in china it reminded me of enhyp3n sungh**n&#x27;s rise in china. but now rk&#x27;s
down to around 14000+ and yj&#x27;s supertopic checkins have actually increased and
are around zh&#x27;s they both average 21000+ so things do change over time.

all this to say that chinese popularity and selling power is fluid for me it&#x27;s a
long-term thing to look at rather than the most recent magazine or endorsement
sale it&#x27;s hard for zbwon though because only some members give you enough
chances to even start measuring it. ngl not sure if that all made sense srry it
was long</p>

      <p><p>Yea when I posted that last mag stat I said it&apos;s based on circumstance like if you&apos;re pumping out consistent mags with other things it&apos;s not gonna be the same as a first big mag sale. Idt anyone seriously believes that a one off stat solidifies the current popularity scape I mean hopefully.. but I just posted to post. I find the cent sale stuff interesting cuz like you said it&apos;s rly fluid but it can get annoying when ppl here get so anal ab it cjfnfmfmdm but dw you make sense not everyone&apos;s smart</p></p>

      <p>yep i love a good nuanced conversation about sales and popularity there&#x27;s so
many little factors that influence different metrics but it&#x27;s annoying when
people take one stat as the sole indicator of something. on the topic of
supertopic checkins tho it&#x27;s interesting how in the current Chinese zbwon
landscape yj who&#x27;s often second by a little bit can lag behind on weekdays when
a lot of younger fans are in school but he&#x27;ll can be around or at zh&#x27;s numbers
on weekends and school breaks yj really has the younger casual student cfans in
a chokehold it almost reminds me of rk&#x27;s reach on the international side where
their strengths lie in casual popularity rather than core fd</p>
