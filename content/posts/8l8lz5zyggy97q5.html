      <p>Afaik everyone had a fancall schedule (starriver fancall event, 15 fancalls per
member) that started at 10pm KST <a href="https://weibo.com/7748169268/Ppw1IoGGa">https://weibo.com/7748169268/Ppw1IoGGa</a> and the
anniversary live started at 11pm KST. They were all at the company so it&#x27;s not
like the other 4 were lazing around, idk what went wrong. There might&#x27;ve been
issues with some fancalls because according to a repo, some jao fans had bonus
fancalls with other members while they waited for jao&#x27;s own fancalls to end?
<a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5161633299568212">https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5161633299568212</a> &quot;Due to some unexpected
circumstances, op ended up chatting with another member between two fancalls,
but was caught on the spot by Teacher Zhang&quot; and that&#x27;s just even weirder to me
because these fans were supposed to have a fancall with one member only (see the
list in the first link) but this girl got an extra fancall for free ðŸ˜’

I don&#x27;t see why wk1 couldn&#x27;t have made them wait until everyone was free IF (key
word: if) the main problem was technical issues or whatever, but who knows. Xhs
girlies say everyone left the company very late so, again, it&#x27;s not like the
other 4 rushed back to the dorms after finishing the fancall event. It&#x27;s
weird...</p>

      <p><p>this is just bullshit pon bullshit wdym ppl got free fancalls WHEN THESE ARE THE SAME PPL WHO ALREADY GET EVERYTHING ðŸ˜­ idt the 4 rushed back leaving the other 5 for dead but it does seem worse that they were there and then monkey ass jwtr sending pc messages ghjhgjekgjh ik there wasnt enough chairs but it rlly cant be that hard to drag some more into a room like plz. everything ab this &quot;anniv&quot; live was casual so it was def unplanned and wkn shouldnt have let a live thats gonna tear ppl up happen but its also the fact that there was nothing in place.. nothing planned.. theyre sooooo shit ugh. i think its fair to question the other 4 still because it doesnt seem like they had any real excuse but whatever we srsly stan the stickiest group to ever do it</p></p>
