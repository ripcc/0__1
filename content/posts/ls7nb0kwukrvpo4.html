      <p>Now camping on Weibo and watching the cr0s1ns try attempt number 3175465 to
overthrow/take back control of their cbar cos they&#x27;ve had enough of the cbar
heads....let&#x27;s see if they succeed this time, I theorise the cbar heads has yh
staff in there but the r0s1ns have numbers on their end.</p>

      <p>Eeehh, yh is known for contacting cbars and coordinating events with them so
that the cbar can later relay accurate information to the fans but I don&#x27;t think
they actually manage any cbar. The heads of Rk&#x27;s old cbar were scammers and a
new cbar had to be created by other fans just last year, Yj&#x27;s current cbar
almost quit out of stress, and R*s1n Estrella (Zh&#x27;s third cbar) was created way
before he won bp. The identity of the 3 admins of Zh&#x27;s current cbar is public
knowledge and they&#x27;re just very stubborn fans with huge egos. If anyone wants
tea, their weibo user names are @持证发财 @奔奔喜欢吃榴莲 and @怪力少女梁春娇 But yeah, they need
to step down.</p>

      <p>Holy shit crosins actually did it. The three admins left 🎉🎉🎉 the new problem
is that the cbar has no management now but they opened applications again so
maybe they&#x27;ll announce the new admins soon.</p>

      <p>Tbh idt many themselves even know about it because I didn’t even know anything
till I read stuff here, none of my rosin moots know anything is going on. This
reminds me of when Ricky’s whole c bar incident was going on and barely anyone
on the I side knew what was going down</p>

      <p><p>i can give a shitty one but ik someone here can give a much better recap lol</p><p></p><p>it was last yr and when fundraising for rkys custom mic the cbar collected funds but went behind everyones back to personally pay in full, this would make this girl the sole donation. pissed a lot of ppl off cuz she wanted rky to personally thank her im realizing now ive forgotten a lot of stuff but she essentially scammed these ppl amongst other things. and then noyb brought it onto twt when rky never used it because well he shouldnt its not from fans but that flopped. WOW IM FORGETTING EVERYTHING 😭</p></p>

      <p>From what i rmb



 * A chinese gf stan wanted to gift the mic herself to rky for his bday (for her
   delulu reasons) but needed to contact wakeone for design approvals and the
   only way is through his cbar so she made a scheme with his cbar (ig they&#x27;re
   prob friends with the admins) to disguise it as a mic fundraiser from all his
   fans to get in contact with wakeone

 * Cbar sent mic proposal fundraiser idea and mic designs to wakeone and wakeone
   approved the fundraiser and sent the the designs to rky so he can pick

 * Cbar opened up fundraiser and started collecting money for the mic and fans
   donated because they thought their money was for the mic only

 * Midway through the fundraising rky picked the design and wakeone emailed his
   cbar with his design choice and then the gf stan went to the mic production
   right away and paid in full using all her own money

 * Cbar is still collecting funds btw

 * I forgot if the fundraiser finished or it was near completion but someone
   leaked that rky already received the mic

 * Ris were confused cuz the fundraiser is still going or just completed so how
   did he get his mic already? it takes weeks to produce

 * Ris did some digging and found out about the gf stan and what she did then
   ris questioned the cbar where their money went

 * Cbar tried to make an excuse and said don&#x27;t worry your money from the
   fundraiser will go towards other gifts for his bday

 * Ris are pissed cuz they donated with the intention of it going towards his
   mic only and did not want rky to use a mic from a gf stan cuz her intentions
   were clearly delulu selfish reasons

 * Ris mass refunded.. something something happened but the cbar didn&#x27;t refund
   and ran off with the money or something and got sued.

 * Ris demanded wakeone to not let rky use that gf stan mic and headset, the red
   one btw

 * In the seoul tour preparation zepisode you see rky wearing a red headset mic
   from the gf stan so i guess he didn&#x27;t know all this was happening

 * Ris also spammed his pchat threatening to unstan him if they see him wearing
   the red custom mic from the gf stan

 * Ris and cbar still fighting, don&#x27;t know who to trust anymore so they created
   a new cbar and created a new fundraiser for a new mic fundraised by all fans

 * Because it&#x27;s a new fundraiser and old cbar didn&#x27;t refund the money it took
   longer to collect the funds and then they still had to wait for it to be
   produced.

 * That&#x27;s why rky was the only one without a custom mic during their tour, even
   though he had one from the gf stan he couldn&#x27;t use it. Then I forgot when but
   around october or november he finally got his new mic the white and silver
   one.

Pretty much it and it was so messy on weibo and I&#x27;m a nosey rosin so I saw it
all happen kjsfhlakfhlakh</p>
