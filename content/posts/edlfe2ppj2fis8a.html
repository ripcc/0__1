      <p>my opinion: i think the setlist is decent but the random luckyaz duo makes no
sense for now and only caused tweakings for the biggest schizophrenics but ig if
they switch around the duo for the next 2 days I can get behind it I think some
of the solo performances are lame too but ig the members chose it so girl
whatever and I wish they had more fun segments i really wanted fancon clips to
go viral like 17 dancing songs that don&#x27;t suit them segment or like tvz ðŸ˜¢ altho
rk bambi is doing decently so I&#x27;ll take it</p>
