      <p>the new bp2 ktrainee center is apprently a chop and knetz are ragging on him
heâ€™s also an indv trainee but allegedly secretly in wki so heâ€™s gonna debut and
when he does youâ€™re probably gonna see levels of favoritism never been seen
before</p>

      <p>The whole Wkaone trainee thing was a rumor. Fans just ran with it since it
benefits them, yknow just some casual kpop stan shit. I watched the two centers
fancams and ðŸ’€ Get them both off of the stage. This season is gonna flop
internationally (less popular than first), they will probably be more popular in
kr, ch and jp though. Their nice visuals cant do anything for shit</p>

      <p>I feel bad they are proper dogging on kgw because of the rumour and itâ€™s not
even true ðŸ˜­ someone else said it about a different show (wswf) but alot of
people already come in with a negative opinion/ image of the k group simply
because they are from korea. So no matter if they are talented or put in the
work there will always be the favouritism card being thrown around.</p>

      <p><p>i think he can still be favored without being a wkn trainee but that extra rumor layer isnt gonna do him any good</p></p>
