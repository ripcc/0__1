      <p>genuine question to the masses if anyone has an answer for me: why are some
people so against hanbin being gay when he 99% likely is? i&#x27;ve never been able
to understand why people (even shippers) will fr call you biphobic for saying
he&#x27;s gay like i&#x27;ve never understood lmfao especially combined with the fact that
they&#x27;ll call you homophobic if you call jiwoong gay or bi like lmao what? i&#x27;ve
never gotten this why are people so offended about hanbin being gay like why
does the thought of him not being into women actually make people angry ðŸ˜­ even
shippers btw the amount of people i&#x27;ve seen saying he&#x27;s &quot;only gay for hao&quot; is so
disgusting like no he&#x27;s gay whether hao existed or not</p>
