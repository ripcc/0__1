      <p>Woah after watching 3rd fancon it’s clear gyuvin, Ricky &amp; Yujin is so bad at
lipsyn like open your mouth guys &amp; guy &amp; yuj has so less self confident in
singing it’s so clear then their unc who is overconfident who make me laugh like
he ruin by screaming, I actually feel bad for jao he was trying so to hype &amp;
make it good performance then his two member with bad lipsyn, less confident &amp;
weird hand movement dance, I really gyuvin should get scolded by their strict
dance teacher so he understands we’re he lacking. Especially him, yuj, tae &amp;
uncl also sometime Rick, I really don’t understand he had good vocal &amp;
captivating performer but sometimes he give all &amp; sometime he doesn’t even try.
Also I think taerae is who can never be good in dance his style is so different
atleast he can sing. &amp; i think it clearly show who is talented member who has
potential &amp; who is accessories &amp; last, rick casually singing his part after unc
did his Owoo part was so embarrassing he can’t even sing that &amp; eat him, I
actually feel bad for his granny &amp; bro who came But I really really enjoy the
fancon just wish they had little fun game which involve fans like dance or guess
the song or something overall it was fun</p>

      <p>tr: ive literally never looked at tr dancing and thought he looks &#x27;bad&#x27; he&#x27;s no
hb gwk or even jao but he holds his own very well but maybe i just have
different standards for main vocals but he&#x27;s surely above the likes of gv and
jwg who are supposedly the &#x27;dance members&#x27;



gv: no comment on his dancing he can improve we all agree but he was definitely
singing for most of his parts especially on his stage with tr he was sanginggggg



rk: idc if he lipsyncs from time to time he just wants to serve face sometimes
and anyways whenever he sings with his raw voice on stage he sounds amazing and
just like studio



yj: honestly agree i think he has a lot of potential as a vocalist but he seems
scared to sing



jwg: well.. yea</p>
