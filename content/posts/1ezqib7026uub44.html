      <p>Gv jacket was the only thing he wore from Fendi. He probably got it from Hb. Gv

Master of Damage Control for real ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£</p>

      <p>I meant that it could be the Idol themselve choosing to wear the brand too. When
someone wears the brands shoes or an upcoming line thats not available, thats
when Im like &quot;Yeah, they got sponsored&quot;</p>

      <p><p>it&apos;s gotten so common for airports to be used as sponsorship hubs so unless they&apos;re wearing designer in their own time (they don&apos;t) then we can say it&apos;s their own clothes </p></p>

      <p>Most Idols buy items specifically to wear them at the airport tho? They want to
look good for the press. You cant really say &quot;an Idol never wear designer
outside of the airport so when they do wear designer they must be sponsored&quot;
Thats a flawed way of thinking</p>
