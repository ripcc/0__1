      <p>i saw this all go down people werenâ€™t naming that group as the one who made fun
of op for her accent (no one knows who that idol is so far) they were naming
idols they had bad experiences with (someone commented that 17 fatshamed their
friend) and absix were brought up too cuz people said they had bad experiences
at their last tour. i dug into it cuz im nosy and apparently a couple of them
were rude to volunteer staff but then their fans said the staff was weird. bg
fans get real defensive though so who knows
