      <p>Different anon, i actually did like it and think it would have been nice to see
a little snipped like that for each dorm but they panned to dorm 2/3 just showed
their rooms and then showed them going to jws for a meal ðŸ’€ like we could have
cut out the car content and showed more of the dorm life tbh even just 5 mins</p>
