      <p>She&#x27;s just someone who makes videos to defend them against hate on tiktok. She&#x27;s
really not an anti. At most, she was just slightly shady and said lsf got
dragged for their vocals (a fact) and she&#x27;s not even hater level but they&#x27;re
calling her international sojang? This is so overblown as an attempt to drag njz
and whatever she said was really nothing compared to the njz haters she was
responding to.</p>
