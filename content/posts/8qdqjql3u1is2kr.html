      <p>from what i know he got gigs from the outside tho? his mnet gigs (except the
ones he mcs in) are the same as the other members (who have gotten mnet gigs).
he most likely would have been an mc somewhere else if mcd wouldn&#x27;t have picked
him ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it was clear from day 1 that workdol was not going to chose a male
idol. they know what their audience wants and what reaches the gp, boy groups
simply dont</p>
