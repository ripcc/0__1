      <p>Y'all wouldn't like to hear this but I have been seeing bulge videos of kpop
idols in xhs, they posted that one video of janbin and haehyun during mc behind
where haehyun was looking at his bulge, and everyone in the comments were like
"I don't know who he is but he looks small" probably because of this.
