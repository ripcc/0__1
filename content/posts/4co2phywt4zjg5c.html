      <p>what did you think abt jnnie&#x27;s coachlla set? i saw a few praises last night but
i actually watched it this morning and it was very boring... i think she lacked
a lot energy almost like it was hard for her to stand still? idk and she was
barely singing. now i&#x27;m seeing similar opinions on twitter like it was boringgg</p>
