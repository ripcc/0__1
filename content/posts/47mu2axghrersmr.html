      <p>Does he not want to be an idol anymore? The fan wasn&#x27;t ever being creepy or
anything. Maybe he&#x27;s sick of being called cat/kitty/mao mao? ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>wait remember that one rumor that said one of the members is gonna quit idol
life after jebis or something? and then an anon alluded to rk? maybe its true
and explains why he barely posts on sns maybe he wants to limit his online
presence as much as he can so it cant be used against him in the future
especially if hes going the business route ðŸ˜­ yo i wanna cry ðŸ˜­</p>
