      <p>ok so i skimmed through 2 eps of the manager show to see what tea was so first
of all the show always has 2 members from the group along with the cast react to
the stuff recorded. and out of the 1 hour and 30 mins only 30 mins or so
actually shows the idol group while the rest is them recording some khia cast
member from the show. idek what was going on at the end tbh but the idol group
invited is not shown at all after the first 30 mins except the 2 members who
were reacting are forced to laugh at whatevers happening for the rest of hour
(shit was not funny AT ALL)



1) so i watched lassarfims. in their ep they dont show their dorm at all and it
starts directly at the hype building. they only show their practices and stuff.
but since our article said we will see their dorm so im guessing our ep wont be
like theirs



2) in tw$ episode they start at the group waking up at their dorm and then
getting ready to go to some concert. they show who the roomates are, their room
arrangements and decorations and also where the manager lives</p>
