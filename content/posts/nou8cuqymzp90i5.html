      <p>ngl in my head coming close was like 200-300k in this declining state of sales
the only way i could see it happening was if there was another repeat of a
chinese #1 but with the separation its probably not happening anymore and i dont
see (HOPE) bp2 becoming as big as bp in the first place</p>
