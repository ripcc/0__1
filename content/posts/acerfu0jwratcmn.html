      <p>this gon be out of pocket but K@ngmin has the energy he has some skeletons in
his closet and has the vibe of a dom. I’ve been a fan of Vrvr since the debuted
and he’s always projected a cute image but he has some hot psychotic energy that
you can notice at times when he isn’t forcing the cute image and when he’s
interacting with people - the cute stuff isn’t always natural and he shockingly
isn’t super aegyo pilled but I think he does it mostly out of habit from being
his group’s maknae and having to do it a lot in the past. I get it - he does
have a nice smile and he’s twink thin and fits a lot of beauty standards - but
really he has some interesting vibes and I think he’ll make it in the group and
he’ll be useful. It’s funny af he smokes and makes me cackle when you can see
his mask slip - usually in lives. Pay attention to him as you watch the show -
interesting personality and he’s pretty calculated too.</p>
