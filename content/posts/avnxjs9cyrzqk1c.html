      <p>yeah i was so confused by all the posts saying the members arent allowed to post
about hb's bday like where did y'all get that idea from... they probably just
texted him or told him in person they just didn't think about posting for it lol</p>

help yourself get out of this misery ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Your bias just doesnt want to post on
there, nobody is saying No to him ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Atp its a fact that most boy prefer
posting on Pchat because they also get paid for being active on there and thats
the cold hard truth. Kpop fans are never beating Parasocialism</p>
