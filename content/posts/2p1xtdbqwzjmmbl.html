      <p>Girl you cannot tell me you were satisfied with Zh getting paired up with Yj
instead of getting a solo stage?? The only reason they put Yj with Zh is cause
Yj cant sing for shit. I also have not seen them trend on X. It was mostly
annoying ass Allins bragging with the fact that Hb ranked above Jebes on X. Its
good that Crosins will collect money for a protest truck. They do so much for
the group and Zh not even getting a solo stage at their fancon is how they want
to repay them??</p>
