      <p>crying bc i just went on one of those p*nnchoa posts about this n*t w*sh scandal
and there was a screenshot of a korean tweet in there that said they should add
my*ng j*ehyun and s*ng h*nbin into w*sh NOW WHY IS HB IN IT but also i find it
funny bc everyone here seems to think that hb&#x27;s boring (not me hehe) and yet
this person is saying to add him to the group to make it better (though i
understand that apparently his humour/personality resonates better with the
korean audience).... how bad are w*sh omg</p>
