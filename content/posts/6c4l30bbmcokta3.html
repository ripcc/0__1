      <p>oooh let an evol rant for a minute this has been pmo so bad... like obviously
they dgaf about being referred to using she/her since thats p common in the gay
community for queer men (plus in their native languages gendered pronouns aren&#x27;t
really a thing so why would they care about english pronouns that much) and
somehow that has turned into western fans literally telling people they identify
as non binary? like the members themselves said that what they mean by
&#x27;genderless&#x27; is dressing outside of the traditional gender norms and styles,
it&#x27;s nothing to do with how they themselves identify? god forbid a gay man
presents more feminine lest everyone just assign them as genderqueer when they
themselves have never said anything like that</p>

      <p><p>no cuz thats what i thought too the point of their genderless concept was to break status quo not become representatives of smth else i get that fans would find comfort in them theyre the first group to do this but lmao with how neuro intl kpop twt is i expected this much </p></p>
