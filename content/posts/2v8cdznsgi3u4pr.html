      <p>Dont know if you noticed or hesrs but its basically confirmed that Zh went to
the Gucci event through Gucci China. Guccis Weibo post called him Brand friend
and the X post (for global) didnt mention any title, just the group name. Its
kinda crazy how Yh has these connections in the industry but they didnt plan on
doing anything with it until their last year. They will for sure mention that to
get him to resign</p>
