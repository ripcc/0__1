      <p>does anyone kniw if they&#x27;re split into teams or something for the horror
content? i thought it was interesting they were in their dorm arrangements in
the poster but the individual posters are different units (except jao2bnz) but
idk if this is an individual thing/working together/working in teams lol</p>

      <p>they work together as a team to hide from the seekers by the end of the game if
more than half the group is not captured zeroses will get a gift. posters are
released in 333 probably to increase excitement and expectation as the quotes on
the posters are what the members actually said in the show. if you’re interested
to understand the show before zbwon episode i’d recommend riice’s theirs are fun
to watch</p>
