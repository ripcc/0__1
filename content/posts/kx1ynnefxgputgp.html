      <p>I&#x27;m crying if that hanbin cmag June thing is true ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ they had to give them 3+
months notice because if it was a 24h or couple of days it wouldn&#x27;t crack 5k
sales lmfao</p>

      <p>I mean the whole reason the c bar told people what it was is because people were
going round saying they were lying. Like do you guys not remember the rosins
literally saying the c bar got scammed ( not that it makes any sense in the
context) the magazine originally contacted hanbinâ€™s c bar in November and it was
only made public at all because wakeone was ghosting them. Like sure they
probably would have done longer sales like Rickyâ€™s or yujins instead of 24h but
it getting revealed early wasnâ€™t exactly for the reasons anons say.</p>
