      <p>Iâ€™ve seen two Flight into for Japan being sold for July so idt they will
comeback then. I have a horrible feeling wki is going to announce cb at kc0n La
in august and have the cb late august early September right before tour, since
we know this is practically their last one they seem to want to do it as late as
possible</p>
