      <p>this actually doesnt suprise me I wonder if that&#x27;s the case for a lot of them
because I dream a lot about stuff irl like school or work so if I was constantly
seeing the same person they&#x27;d probably make their way into my dream too.</p>

      <p>loooooooool this reminds me of sunlightshb who i think was brought up in your ns
or cc (didn&#x27;t someone somehow find out she went to yonsei? though i&#x27;ve heard
they take in so many international students that it&#x27;s not even that prestigious
for them anymore - might&#x27;ve been for master&#x27;s tho) before like i get she must
have a really high paying job in korea if she can go to so many events but also
how does she get so much time off (like she went to quite literally every single
date of the last tour) and how does she seem to get into every single fansign
when that&#x27;s supposed to be based on luck like does she buy hundreds of albums
for EVERY single one? she&#x27;s living the life tho. hb and zh might dream about her
since she&#x27;s a jaobin fan ðŸ¤”</p>
