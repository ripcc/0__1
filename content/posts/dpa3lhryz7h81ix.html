      <p>Bnd getting dragged so bad on weibo üò≠üò≠ apparently their concert in Bangkok got
cancelled due to the earthquake and they didn&#x27;t notify the fans or say anything,
they quietly and quickly just flew back to Seoul without letting the fans know
so that they don&#x27;t have more competition for plane tickets since everyone is
trying to get out of there</p>

      <p>Yeah I saw vids of them at the airport ignoring the fans and walking quickly it
was crazy and they didnt say a word until they landed in korea it&#x27;s crazy and
the situation in bangkok isnt good at all... a bunch of their cfans who went for
the concert were mad as shit and unstanned them there&#x27;s posts with 100k+
dragging them</p>

      <p>Honestly I can see H**e telling the members not to interact with the fans or
just stay silent.



If sleep1 i can see them going both ways either asking the boys to stay silent
and then telling them to post something after seeing the inferno on weibo. Or
maybe sleep1 reacts better as they&#x27;re also pretty tuned into the Chinese market.</p>

      <p><p>apparently there were witness counts of a cfan getting kidnapped and ppl are still missing it&apos;s actually rlly scary I didn&apos;t even realize just how rash their departure was. Peend fled at 1 am the day of and the concert was supposed to be at 6pm so imagine the amt of ppl who still flew in cuz they posted the cancellation late ALSO apparently the venue did post smth earlier but took it down. I don&apos;t have any standards for how wkn would act but I think this whole situation does reflect on peends personality&apos;s ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I just don&apos;t think zbwon would go out like that even if they were told to stay silent </p></p>
