      <p>random af but ive always wondered how ttopaz has like 300k followers on weibo
and assumed her page mustve been for someone else before her xhs page came up
for me and i scrolled back and shes a huge cristiano ronaldo fan idk how she
jumped from that to rkyðŸ˜­ i guess it makes more sense why shes one of the few
cris who fw his muscles</p>

      <p>yesðŸ˜­her pinned post on xhs is her going on a trip to portugal to visit the
ronaldo museum in 2023 if the translate is accurate she said she was a fan since
she was 13 and shes now 30 the fact that both her and n0yb werenâ€™t kpawp fans
before rky makes so much sense</p>
