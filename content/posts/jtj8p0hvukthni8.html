      <p>i did a fansign slot for the shanghai fansign and it actually cooked omg the
jiejies donâ€™t play about audio/video recordings my shit was clear asfk and i had
a really smooth experience from transaction to receiving of the materials (video
+ postit) so if anyone wants to try them out for the next cb GO ON XHS LOL. use
a translator to send the first message in chn but let them know from the getgo
that you canâ€™t speak the language and theyll speak to u in english. members are
priced based on chn fame so keep that in mind but ngl prices there are sm better
than what iâ€™ve seen some intl fans do for much less services. and if you stan
someone w a small fandom in chn go ham bc theyre always looking for people to
buy those slots. if u have any more qs just ask n ill try to come back to answer</p>

      <p>u need to go for gwk or mtw or both LOL i didnt but ive seen their slots theyre
real good prices vary bc member fame but also they offer multiple things (signed
page, video message, postit, all of the above) for individual and full prices.
for full slots that have all the 3 things i mentioned i think prices go from 600
to 2300 chinese yuan per member. the jiejies can speak english and actually
prefer doing that when they speak to the members (unless theyre talking to cline
ofc) but naturally there are barriers (knowing what to search on xhs and texting
asap etc) but it was worth it or maybe my fav just ate that up for me ðŸ˜‹</p>
