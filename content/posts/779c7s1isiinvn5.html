      <p>side note i hate this new trend of aboutmusic/kchartsmaster/popbase/popcrave
copycats that focus on a specific idol/group that have popped up in the past
month or so. they&#x27;re so cornyyyyyyyyyy idc if it&#x27;s lighthearted, something about
it is just so lame to me in a way the normal chart/global accounts for idols
aren&#x27;t ğŸ˜­</p>
