      <p>and this is why people should never talk without waiting for a lil bit. anons
eating their own words right now because it actually did make it to the top 1 on
bugs and it did enter some genie or melon chart (probably hot100 not top100).
its very obvious what type of fan anon belongs to because ppl saying hb is the
most popular member in korea, shouldnt hurt you this much 💀 pretty sure that
this anons been waffling about stupid shit over on aestasmoons mond too. going
as far as sending links from akgaes 😭😭 you are not slick</p>
