      <p>This is where I think kpop stans get ignorant to real like issues because hrbz
not going is definitely because of the political tension between china and
taiwan right now and itâ€™s only gotten worse recently like no one could have
predicted the recent escalation so it probably wasnâ€™t even an issue when wk1
agreed for them to be there. Especially when other groups with chn members were
still doing events in Taiwan. Them not going is more for their own safety than
anything ðŸ˜­.

      <p>china taiwan relations have always been rocky but jb1 and other chinese artists
have gone to Taiwan several times including this year but it just so happens the
relations have gotten extra shaky just this week and the event was booked months
in prior when it was better they probably tried to get the visa to work till the
very last moment but it didn&#x27;t as taiwan is extra cautious about letting in
Chinese nationals into the region this week</p>
