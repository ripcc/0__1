      <p>Hot take Thursday: Seunghw@n should’ve replaced J!woong in the final line up,
Newjeens is actually in the right, stanning K@tseye is actually more unethical
than most other kpop groups because of their insanely close tie to Scooter
Br@un, for some people stanning only boy groups is them centering their lives
around men (I’m not saying all but I’m talking about insane freaks), I actually
do wish idols were more transparent with who they voted so they’d rightfully get
called out (but this will never become a norm because its unprofitable), PLAyVE
is actually one of the most theoretically ethical kpop groups because they keep
their anonymity (besides the leaks) but their designs are corny, Close Your
Eyees will be one of the bigger kpop boy groups in the next year because of
their creative direction (shout-out early KI@F director for that - she left
their company and stopped working with KI@F because KI@F’s company didn’t want
Igl@@ to be the title track which is what the director wanted (and was right in
hindsight)), Scoops from SV/T shouldn’t have gotten that military exemption
because how are you doing choreo and jumping on stage but can’t handle bootcamp
lollll, and Minggyu and Wonw@@ from SV/T have some of the worst vibes out there.
Oh yeah, Keh@@‘s a top.</p>
