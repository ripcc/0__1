      <p>this whole thing is making me cry like we finally thought we were getting our
long overdue ot9 dorm content and we get this mess ðŸ˜­ it&#x27;s so frustrating idk if
wk1 is to blame or the network but it just really goes to show nobody knows how
to properly market jb1 was it really that difficult to just showcase what their
day to day life was without it being so scripted and full of ad placements. at
the end of the day zrses just want to see the boys goof around with each other.
ricky lowkey saved the show with his segment and i&#x27;m kinda sick of hao2binz tbh.
The unc segment also killed me because it&#x27;s so blantantly scripted like them
mentioning how he always cooks for the members when non of the members ever
bring that up during their lives or M+chat ðŸ˜­ they always take pics of food they
eat and not once have they taken pics of jw&#x27;s cooking</p>
