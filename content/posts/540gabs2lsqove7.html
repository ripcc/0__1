      <p>Umm wonâ€™t the all-star team win every time against 1 star? How is it a
competition.. the 2 star battles would at least be interesting if we canâ€™t
predict the winners but itâ€™s rising sun and ktr which are the harder songs.
Thereâ€™s people with supposedly good vocals and theyâ€™re doing whiplash and plot
twist ðŸ¤¨</p>
