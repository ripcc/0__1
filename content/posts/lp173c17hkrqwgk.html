      <p>Sorry anon and queef but Iâ€™m pretty sure there was already a big rumour that the
trainees were already moving into the dorms and that it was definitely starting
to be released by mid this year. I think they could definitely have two shows
going on at similar times considering they arenâ€™t going for the same market.</p>

      <p>new street woman fighter is coming out in late may and it&#x27;ll go on for 2 months
at least so not till july so I can see b2p coming out before oct but mnet is
gassing up that hiphop show too much i don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll run it at the same
time as b2p</p>

      <p>Thatâ€™s 3 months and if they have already started filming now itâ€™s fully possible
because bp was like feb to mid April</p>
