      <p>Saw someone say hb might mc for wswf which wouldn’t surprise me since he’s
already an mnet mc, idt kd can do it since he’s going to the military and he’s a
dancer. I just think it’s it’s filming the same day as mca that a crazy amount
of overworking also proves someone’s else point they said on ns about it not
even being a favouritism thing anymore like this is just straight up using him
on their part</p>

      <p><p>This is from 4 days ago I archived since u said it&apos;s just a rumor but now that it&apos;s partially confirmed I&apos;ll postttt. I&apos;m gagged at how this type of schedule and filmings even supposed to work it&apos;s speculated he&apos;s going to be guesting on that key show too apparently like this all reads as impossible... and ik mainly it&apos;s mnet double dipping in their resources so they don&apos;t have to hire outside of it but it still makes me go hmm.. he rlly lucked out working for mnet 😒😑..</p></p>

      <p>It’s giving lazy on their behalf but icl I even see non fans saying he’s a good
choice for mc. Since he’s a good mc and a professional dancer it made a lot of
sense. But this is the same man that was having nosebleeds before/ throughout
blue promo cuz he was so overworked like they really want him to have to take a
health hiatus before disbandment at this rate 😭</p>

      <p>Wait clock it because I feel like you can tell the big difference in when they
try and push him somewhere compared to this. Like push would suggest to me loads
of different areas and exposure in different things. But this is just giving “we
don’t want to go through the process of hiring an mc, we have one who does well
so we’ll just stick him in”. I high key wonder if he’s getting paid for mcing
tbh because Ik idols do but the more I learn about inner workings it’s wouldn’t
surprise me if he wasn’t because it’s all linked to mnet.</p>

      <p><p>Yea this would be diff if it wasn&apos;t purely mnet mcing I still find it annoying but I&apos;m not calling it a push it&apos;s just lazy. I&apos;ve heard too many ranges ab alleged mc pays like 40 bucks to like 3k so idk 😭 idt it would even matter if he got paid he wouldn&apos;t feel the difference with how huge zbwons revenue is, if he isn&apos;t ig they treat the exposure like income </p></p>
