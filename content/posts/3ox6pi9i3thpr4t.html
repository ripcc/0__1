      <p>LMAOOOO no wonder sleepone is trying to bury jbs and get 12 to promote bopel2.
They got 2 of their trainees as the shiny boys or whatever and one even being
the &quot;center&quot; of pre promotion. I know they already counting the nonexistent
money they might get. It is obvious the favoritism is gonna be wiiild after
debut and sucks because the contract is 5y. Good luck in advance to debut
members, even if the group is successful it would be a long hellish ride</p>
