      <p>I don&#x27;t know what is happening but his cbar is struggling, they barely bought
him any gifts and the gifts he got were the cheapest options apparently, also
you know how they decorate the delivery boxes with fancy wrapping or gift bags
with ribbons and bouquet of flowers? Apparently they just sent it in a card box
with shen quan rui written in chinese in permanent marker ðŸ˜­</p>
