      <p>realistically speaking how could we complain to wakeone about the lack of group
content or lives ? if k fans were smart they’d be sending trucks already but ig
they dgaf about this like us int fans do idk…?



spamming the members on pluschat seems to be the only option😭 if we mass
emailed wakeone about it would that even work???</p>
