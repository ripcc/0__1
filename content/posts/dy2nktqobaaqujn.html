      <p>Feel bad for 0s whose first time it is watching the fighter series like I’ve
been here since s1 and these people are haters to their core. Like they never
like anything, literally nothing so I need 0s not to be surprised if they shade
hbn because it’s probably nothing against him as a person they are just rude
like that, they do it to all the mcs special mc guest judges actual judges and
give it another ep they will start fighting between team fandoms too</p>
