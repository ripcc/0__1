      <p>i'm ngl i genuinely thought they were gonna have w4nna 0ne fame LMAOOOOOOOO (i
was a kpop fan during their run but i wasn't a w4nnable and i feel like they
stayed in their own bubble despite them being big in korea so i didn't, and
still don't, have the greatest concept of what exactly their popularity was
like). like i know people said to not really expect that but the way their
popularity during b0ys pl4net with all the public appearances at fan projects
was (and for eg when yhz celebrated 0llie's birthday.. a day to remember) and
how it felt like they were the talk of the town about i was genuinely hopeful
that they'd be at least pretty well liked by the gp 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 that
quickly changed though</p>

      <p><p>BRO DONT EVEN GET ME STARTEDDDD WE WERE PROMISED WANNATWO NOT THIS 😭.. i genuinely held some resentment for the group pre ftp cuz i felt so catfished how dare they ruin my first survival show experience 😒 from what ive learned wnnaone started off with insane popularity like peak xo/btc popularity that the fall off didnt even matter cuz its inevitable. but yessss their april popularity during the show was insane i rmbr they ahd fans OUTSIDE the arena where the finale was it was insanity they were even surpassing producex likes on melon and charting with show songs.. liek what happened.. what went wrong.. they were big enough to make big4 companies nervous.. ik ppl say the management from all the produce groups and zbwon were the same but i cant help but feeling like it rlly wasnt. we got a company that was known to plunder their FAILED chop groups a company that had SHARTPLER.. and all their detrimental mistakes were solely due to their lack of preparedness and resources WE WERE DEALT SHIT CARDS 🤬 </p></p>
