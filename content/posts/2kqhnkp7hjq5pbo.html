      <p>it is funny how these people tweak while assuming how much gwk gf stans crashing
out on his pc, but their braincells cannot fathom that if gwk truly read them
crashing out means none of these loud shippers paid a penny to assure him what
he did on inki content is fine. too much barking for individuals that couldn&#x27;t
even carry the awards voting as much as they hype the ship. at least jaobnist
did something for their ship. heck, even some haters are more dedicated to pay
for pc subs. some idols might not care about money e.g. gwk make sure mnet won&#x27;t
touch his fans who uploaded his paid content with copyrights bs, but the company
always love money. ofc idols will be told to cater to the ones making more
money, no matter how much those idols love their fans equally. not surprised
tho, most shippers not limited to mttwok shippers don&#x27;t really stream/vote/paid
for anything. if they do, they only did it for one of them and abandon the other
one</p>
