      <p>if they drop the envve dudes and the new faces are around yjn's age there's
actually a chance that gyub will be the leader because obviously rik is out of
the list and jao, if he included in the group, bet his fans wont like him as the
leader and idt dha will fumble it if she succeeds in making him stay considering
that he's their current biggest moneymaker in the kpop scene</p>
