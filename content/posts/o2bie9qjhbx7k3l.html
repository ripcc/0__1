      <p>i dont think he knows that you need to play with the cat toys with the cat ðŸ˜­
g1a has sooooo much energy bc he&#x27;s a kitten, so he should be playing with him a
lot but you can see that g1a bites him a lot and is easily overstimulated so
he&#x27;s definitely not getting enough attention... the kitten phase is the worst
even tho they&#x27;re really cute at that phase but they just have so much energy and
you have to spend a lot of time with them and based on every vid I&#x27;ve seen of
the cat he&#x27;s definitely not playing enough with the cat/// being a first time
cat owner is hard but i hope he reads up on it to make the poor kitten&#x27;s life
easier

      <p>I scream at my phone every time he lets the cat play and bite with his hands.
Like no you need to stop that habit while theyâ€™re young ðŸ˜­ Iâ€™ve learned to just
always have one hand swing around a cat wand whenever Iâ€™m on a work call</p>

      <p>I saw his kfans talking about this too and they said they&#x27;ll send letters to him
and include how to train the cat ðŸ˜­ his ifans are so clueless keep laughing at
that cat biting him thinking it&#x27;s cute no one&#x27;s trying to give him some
hints/tips to train that cat when he&#x27;s on int side of twt a lot</p>
