      <p>anon... his own fans sued ktkt thats how bad it was 😭 ktkt sent him to shanghai
the richest business province in china only to put him in a budget hotel where
he had to live stream in the bathroom cause theres no tables, advertised as a
private fanmeet but last minute announced that the fanmeet was gonna be public
in a mall with randos after paying $$$ but now anyone can see him for free,
fans/ fansites got doxxed and ktkt invited a bunch random influencers to sit
front row for free which got him into so many dating influencer scandals because
ppl were like wait why are they there it gotta be some personal connections 😭
it was bad</p>

      <p>izeroses dont know the damage so ill share LOL there was this one travel beauty
food influencer with 10k followers basically nothing 💀 who posted a pic of her
at the fanmeet but before the event started so she had the stage to herself and
xhs girlies were like oh she must be a vip because why else is she allowed there
so early before fans? and she kept liking comments about them looking good
together and how she must be his gf so that&#x27;s why she was there early 💀 that
post got like 100k likes when her avg was 500 likes and the comments were full
of speculations about their relationship then xhs girlies scrolled her page and
realized she was actually a fan of his and she went to their first debut fancon
and timeless tour in seoul concert all 3 days and she would post pics of her
eating at the same places he&#x27;d eat at (from his bbl/ pc posts) with her own
friends so xhs girlies started this rumor of them being friends and having a
situationship and how she visits him in korea all the time 😭



but the dates never matched, he&#x27;d post on bbl/pc, fans figure out where he ate
at and post the location then 2-3 weeks later she goes to korea with her own
friends and eats at the same place and post pic of the same dish and a review on
xhs and for the concerts she wasnt even in the vip area where family and friends
sit she was all the way in the back 😭 then later after more digging fans found
out that she has a long term boyfriend who films for her, basically her manager
who&#x27;s with her 24/7 and was also at the ktkt fanmeet and was confirmed she was
just a fan and her bf had connections with ktkt so that was how she was able to
go to the fanmeet and rk doesnt even know who she is 😭 so then she got a lot of
hate for egging the rumor on and her xhs is gone now</p>
