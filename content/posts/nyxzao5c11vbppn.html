      <p>on serious note, i&#x27;m actually very glad that he can sleep well now because he
used to have some troubles in sleeping so if he wanted to sleep after the
schedule is done then it&#x27;s a good sign i think. also he&#x27;s preparing this fancon
while also going back and forth to china for his solo schedules and jp for the
group&#x27;s promotions so i hope he can have a good rest when theres no schedule
tbh. at least when he&#x27;s resting, he wont have to overthink much like yknow
considering what he went thru</p>
