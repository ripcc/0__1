      <p>Antis/akages will come at me... But the news article isn&#x27;t wrong. Anyone with
eyes could see hb was pushed during the show with the way they edited him. Don&#x27;t
get me wrong, hb is talented and popular but you can&#x27;t deny he is mnets son
after everything. Mnet should be lucky to have him especially with Mc-ING skills</p>
