      <p>eh i thought its always obvious since wk1 sent tartar to that masked singer
show? before their official debut and all of his schedules are always
vocal-related (+all those special stages) and now hes got two solo osts and both
for cj&#x27;s dramas. jaehw is gonna enlist as soon as jebe1 disbands too</p>
