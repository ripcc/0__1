      <p>the teaser strategically showing whatever jw was doing in only half of the
screen....... #nooticing. also which one is his room bc i feel like it&#x27;s that
one with the big curtains in the corners and the huge bed like #NAH that doesn&#x27;t
look like a dorm ðŸ˜‚ but also i would&#x27;ve thought they&#x27;d just show a guest room in
one of the dorms rather than go elsewhere so now i&#x27;m like ðŸ¤” imagine if this
whole time he really has been rooming with some of the members it&#x27;s just his bum
ass really has made no effort to get close or interact with them like a normal
person



on a different note, that cramped room below hb&#x27;s must be gv&#x27;s because i swore i
read in one of those bnb ns&#x27; that apparently there&#x27;s tea that his room is really
tiny LMAO so that&#x27;s why i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s jw&#x27;s. the one to the right of
hb/gv&#x27;s rooms looks like rk&#x27;s because of the clothes. before that, it&#x27;s yj/gw/tr
(definitely tr&#x27;s on the right, i assume yj&#x27;s is the one with the piano since
he&#x27;s played it during his lives) and then the non-jw rooms before THOSE rooms
are mt and zh obviously</p>

      <p><p>his room and kitchen look so diff.. to death with him bro get off my show!!!!! they only got 2 rooms and a shoe box in each dorm so theyd have to show the managers living space and thats with mttrik. but the way they showed jwgs room as part of that trio was ðŸ¤” the set up doesnt match the dorms at all but hgfjihjgfk if he rlly does live with them THIS IS DEADBEATERY TO THE FUCKING MAXXXXXXXXXXXXXX i rlly hope he just doesnt live there i like this group as 8 dont careee </p><p></p><p>and yea it def is they all have dorms in the same building we havent seen the tiny room on mttrks floor but we can assume its the managers cuz it would be the same as trs. but wow yjns room is so much bigger than tr and gwks WHY THE FUCK DOES HE HAVE A PIANO IN THERE THATS SOME GREEDY SHIT</p></p>
