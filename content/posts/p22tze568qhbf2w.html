      <p>i will try following all of them (except jw) but i may fall off with the members
who aren&#x27;t my absolute favs which makes me sad (and i&#x27;ve also never stanned a
survival show group but with other ones i noticed that after they disband, the
stans never gaf about their future stuff they only ever talk about missing the
old group like whenever i see people talk about exwon i feel like that wendy
williams video where she&#x27;s like &quot;SO WHY DON&#x27;T YOU BUY HER MUSIC?&quot;) like i
knowwwwwww i&#x27;m gonna be sticking to hb #forlife since he&#x27;s my ult and probably
zh, gw and mt? maybe tr but more wk1 sounds hellish. if any of them go into
acting i&#x27;m gonna be pissed like IDGAF, YOU&#x27;RE IDOLS. BE IDOLS. like i literally
never watch tv shows and i&#x27;ve watched maybe 3 kdramas total in my life like i&#x27;m
really not about that life.... like how do you even follow them. and yeah as an
anon said, stanning soloists seems way less fun like they don&#x27;t have other
members to bounce off. and then i&#x27;m also a lil ????? with zh and rk since i have
no idea how the c-ent industry works so if they venture out there i hope
whatever they do is still accessible and fun. PLEASE i hope their future paths
are interesting and the music isn&#x27;t complete shit üôè</p>
