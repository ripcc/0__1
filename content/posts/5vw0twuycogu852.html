wants and would pursue it, ive seen recent fancalls and its like the third time

said he wanted to do a villain role well good fpr him he can do the villain guy

This Sense controversy is nothing compared to all that and it&#x27;s your typical
cweibo akgae fan war that went unhinge but at least Sense is suing and doing
something about all the hate and slander. And if you&#x27;re a true wony stan you&#x27;d
know starshit BEEN pushing yj since ive debut please don&#x27;t irk me rn ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ UGH
if anything ricky brought her luck cause 2023 till now been nothing but a
blessing, kpop stans finally switched up and started defending her realizing her
hate is so forced PLUS SHE WON AGAINST SOJANG CUZ THAT DUMB HOE THOUGHT SHE
COULD HIDE BEHIND YOUTUBE PROTECTION CUZ SHE AINT AMERICAN BUT WONY FOUND A WAY
AND SUED HER ASS CHANGING THE INDUSTRY AND CAN HOLD MALICIOUS RUMOR SPREADER
ACCOUNTABLE EVEN IF THEIR ASSES IS FROM KOREA.
