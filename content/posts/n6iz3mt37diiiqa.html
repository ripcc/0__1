      <p>The thing is their reputation isn&#x27;t really good either so they&#x27;re shit at their
job periodðŸ˜­ honestly I doubt even the new heads are clean his cbar has always
been known to be messed up and unprofessional (although I didn&#x27;t know it was
that bad) idk how so many people have shielded it for so long I don&#x27;t think
things are ever going to change for good with this bar because it&#x27;s just rotten
to the core and also these letters truly were reflections of the fandom
sentiments, no matter how many times r0sins cancel these super critical fans
it&#x27;s just rooted in their fd culture at this point and they care about other
things way more than this and so I doubt things will ever definitely change.



Now for me, honestly speaking I was kinda frustrated by the things he did
sometimes in the past but this definitely puts things into perspective. like it
must have been really hard for him and I empathise w him a lot. I also heard
about them bugging him about his sexuality in FS and I can only assume a lot of
the other letters had a lot to say about it, so I really respect that he never
gave them what they wanted from him and always rebeled . Honestly atp I wouldn&#x27;t
be surprised if he wants to leave the industry I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s particularly
business minded he seems to be more so the artsy musical type I would understand
it if he is turned off by the idol industry .



But damn honestly who can blame idols for drinking smoking and fucking all the
time this shit is mentally exhausting AFFFF I know he&#x27;s a millionaire but idk if
it&#x27;s worth it honestly</p>
