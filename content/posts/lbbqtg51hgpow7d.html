      <p>People think we are joking when we say that sbn likes his butthole tapped? That
man is not dating any fem idol. We could get into the conversation about how his
bandmate has a one sided crush on him tho.</p>

      <p>yethhhhh and itâ€™s so obvious especially on bmgyuâ€™s end (which is why iâ€™m not
surprised anon called it one sided) to me theyâ€™re like jaobin except theyâ€™re not
a gov ship i donâ€™t even think theyâ€™re in the top 5 xtx ships but lowkey other
than having to witness the stupidity and superiority complex of
yeonb*n/beomj*n/etc. shippers itâ€™s definitely better this way ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like
mattw**k was kindaaa ruined for me by the new wave of shippers once they became
a gov ship mmdmdjs i still fw the ship but yk ðŸ’”</p>
