      <p>For fancalls they should give a person 3 fancalls MAX then donezo like
parasocial relationship is actually so dangerous I forgot if it was theb0yz or
enhyp3n but some chick on xhs almost commited cus she gen thought she was in a
relationship with one of the members and couldn&#x27;t stand it when they&#x27;d flirt
with other fans and said they were cheating ðŸ’€ I mean if you think about it fans
who pay for multiple fancalls are already a bit mentally ill ðŸ˜­ so now they&#x27;re
feeding into it even more like i agree just end that shit ðŸ˜­</p>
