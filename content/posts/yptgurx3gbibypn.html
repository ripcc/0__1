      <p>That reason why that crowd is annoying is not just the fact that they ship eb
with eb or that they think eb in 5B1 is gay, its the fact that yaoi is the only
thing they talk about 💀 or making the most disgusting posts about the membets
themselves for engagement 💀 i have never witnessed this type of behavior in any
other fandom and it probably comes from the fact that alot of the og zeroses
left and nobody asked these people to stop early on</p>

      <p><p>it still very much existed when zbwon was still new but this is just the new kpop fans I accepted it zroses are def excessive tho. every fandom is upping the yaoi chops but you can&apos;t change these ppl it&apos;s the fact that most think they&apos;re queer or they stan a group participating in queer culture or whatever that acc said </p></p>
