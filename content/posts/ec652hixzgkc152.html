      <p>you say it&#x27;s obvious (and it is to me too) but i did some twitter searches
before and there are people saying &quot;and fuck you to everyone who said jw
wouldn&#x27;t be in dorm content&quot; and &quot;this is proof that jw does live in the dorms&quot;
like y&#x27;all can&#x27;t be serious omg</p>
