      <p>og anon here i don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re &quot;letting him go&quot; necessarily he initially had
something called a shadow contract and signed some other contract (not an artist
one) when he debuted in jebi1. if he were to stay in yh he would have to sign a
new contract but by all means he&#x27;s lowk definitely not going to, it&#x27;s also
speculated that their giving him so many sponsorships with no real logic behind
the branding is because they want to make as much money off him as they can
before he leaves.. again this is pretty common knowledge with crosins. i&#x27;m
obviously not talking about casual fans though like these are the ones that get
down</p>

      <p>&quot;their giving him so many sponsorships with no real logic behind the branding
because they want to make as much money off him as they can before he leaves&quot; I
mean, I can see this but then again it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re giving him random
sponsorships either. Sure, the branding cohesiveness isn&#x27;t the best but all the
brands he&#x27;s been a BA for are well-known in cn and have experience with other
popular celebs like ZhaoLusi and XiaoZhan. It isn&#x27;t perfect but it at least
shows that yh has some standards when it comes to jao. It&#x27;s the complete
opposite of what they&#x27;re doing with rky where they accept offers from new and
inexperienced brands that never had BAs before and end up being scammers like
kto kto... If anything, I think rky might be the one to leave because aside from
his solo magazine, yh hasn&#x27;t done anything for him in cn. Sure, he went to that
gucci event and keep running but that was with jao, and correct me if I&#x27;m wrong
but I don&#x27;t think he was officially involved with gucci again after that. Yh
doesn&#x27;t seem to care about rky&#x27;s branding and accepts any offers without doing a
proper background check, he&#x27;s never had a proper solo gig in cn (BA events don&#x27;t
count) while jao had that loewe fashion event early on and even now they&#x27;re
giving him another huge boost with hello saturday. I think someone mentioned
this before but that show airs on hunan tv which is the top 2 most watched
channel in cn. It&#x27;s fucking huge. Why would yh do that for him if he&#x27;s going to
leave? But going back to rky, I honestly feel bad for him because even yjn and
gvn are getting gigs, but what about rky? Hell, let&#x27;s not forget that yh gave
yjn a cn magazine cover before rky ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p><p>im nodding im nodding and yea rkys rlly a good example of someone theyre ready to kick to the curb no shadeeee ðŸ˜­ and i believe ur right never saw him at gucci or be involved again. im glad someone brought this up cuz its rlly interesting to compare and guess how things will turn out but yea i can agree yh is doing all they can to milk zgh but it has purpose as well. but LOL i can see rky leaving asap you get the most yhz branding from the other 3 its almost like hes not a part of them</p></p>

      <p>tbf they could be giving zh all this to try incentivise him into staying like
&quot;we have all these connections/opportunities, if you stay with us you can keep
them&quot; essentially or maybe they don&#x27;t even know that he wants to leave yet (if
that&#x27;s the case) but maybe i&#x27;m thinking like that because i really would like
for him to leave LMAO



at the same time, i definitely could see rk leaving too and they have opposite
brand deal situations so that&#x27;s interesting. yh&#x27;s shit without all this
happening so i think they could just both want to leave regardless of what
they&#x27;re individually getting out of the company</p>
