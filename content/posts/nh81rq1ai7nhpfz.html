they pooled funds for allure and until now its still isnt sold outðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… But since
his cfans were begging for this i expect that they would at least surpass yj

      <p>I mean itâ€™s not sold out on ktown but itâ€™s still sold over 600 copies on ktown
which is quite good in comparison to other mag covers from the group sold there.
You have to remember allure was also sold on a lot of k sites that donâ€™t post
their sales</p>

      <p>iirc forest managed to secure +/-5k sales for allure. considering allure was his
first solo magazine and the magazine itself kept promoting it (they always added
the purchase links incl the global one in their official posts) so of course
fans would go all out for the sales but it still didnt surpass more than 5k
sales so idt he&#x27;ll surpass yjn&#x27;s sales for this time</p>
