      <p>my two cent take on this is everyone was dramatic as fuck ðŸ˜­ I don&#x27;t think it
was that serious they both probably watched their pepero game and were like wait
a min we&#x27;re doing too much we need to tone it down a bit cz why would gwk
announced to the world he&#x27;ll distance himself if he&#x27;s serious ykwim and the pc
messages were just playful banter with fans but yeah I think they&#x27;ll tone down
and maybe it won&#x27;t be same anymore</p>
