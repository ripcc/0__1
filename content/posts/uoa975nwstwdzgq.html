      <p>my opinion: i think the setlist is decent but the random luckyaz duo makes no
sense for now and only caused tweakings for the biggest schizophrenics but ig if
they switch around the duo for the next 2 days I can get behind it I think some
of the solo performances are lame too but ig the members chose it so girl
whatever and I wish they had more fun segments i really wanted fancon clips to
go viral like 17 dancing songs that don&#x27;t suit them segment or like tvz ðŸ˜¢ altho
rk bambi is doing decently so I&#x27;ll take it</p>

      <p><p>i just dont see why theyd switch it around like its probably gonna be stuck like this but everyone will have moved on by tmrw tbh. and i get it sure but they dont get to have 4576584 fancons for the next 10 years to experiment like 17 and tvz i think this fancon was just about finally doing one thats not shit and doing things we havent seen/taking it to the big stage like its rlly all gonna be about the anniversary nothing else</p></p>

      <p>is it possible for them to prepare 3 different solo/unit stages tho considering
how busy they have been and lacked time to practice in between jp promotions and
other schedules. doesnt sound realistic tbh, esp mtt once mentioned like a week
before this fancon that he was still not sure about how&#x27;s the preparation going,
something along the lines</p>

      <p><p>they were talking ab being nervous ab how the fancon would go right? so maybe they did prepare a bunch of diff stages and anon mentioned gyv made it sound like he&apos;d only perform wolves day 1 so</p></p>
