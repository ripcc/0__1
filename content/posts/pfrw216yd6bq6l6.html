      <p><p>Mmmmm I feel like he&apos;d just go blue even if it is less left wing it doesn&apos;t take away the chance of the Conservative Party winning. I was surprised he encouraged fans to go out and vote tho like yasssss</p></p>

      <p>Apparently the blue party ain&#x27;t shit either ðŸ’€ but yeah probably most people who
voted blue didn&#x27;t want red to win but can you imagine how bad it must be on both
sides for the results to be close</p>
