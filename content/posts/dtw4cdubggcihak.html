      <p>FYI Try not to share it too much bc if they start seeing what they say on x or
think they got exposed theyll move to another gallery nd make the name even
harder to find nd a big misconception is that all fans knows about these
galleries but its not true, most of these galleries are from a small group like
normal fans dont know these galleries even exists bc these galleries are mostly
for ranting their displeasure and even likes but just in a safe place away from
the public so haters and antis wont jump on it which i think is completely
healthy bc its basically us here</p>
