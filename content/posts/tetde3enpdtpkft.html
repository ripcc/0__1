      <p>love him mcing but I don&#x27;t want that either tbh, if this show is going to be
airing till the end of the year and he&#x27;s one of the ones were sure that won&#x27;t
resign it just feels mean and tasteless to have him mc for a show that&#x27;s
essentially going to be making their &#x27;replacement&#x27; group</p>

      <p>It&#x27;s precisely because of the won&#x27;t renew contract that they&#x27;ll put him there,
in a &quot;see if u renew you&#x27;ll get all these, if you don&#x27;t well we have plenty of
people who do....&quot; That way his company or himself will go &quot;hmm maybe we need to
think this....&quot;</p>
