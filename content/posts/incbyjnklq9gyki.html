      <p>sorry coke rant incoming but kr0sins annoying me recently with all the weird
(highkey racist) backhanded compliments they're giving jao about being a ì¤‘í‹° or a
ì¤‘ë‚¨ like - saw a fansign clip (that got deleted a couple hrs later at least op
knows shame!) where they're like "jao what do u think of ppl calling you a ì¤‘í‹° -
most chinese men kinda hate being called that" and jao's like fine i guess i'll
take it as a compliment. and some of the engagement with that tweet i saw (incl
from some jaobinists smh) is like "haha so cute he isn't offended by it" like
bruh he might not feel offended by it but it doesn't make it okay! anyway i rlly
feel for jao (and rikky as well) dealing with xenophobic stereotypes all day
long and having to be like model minority "not like other Chinese guys" on their
best behaviour so they don't get a hate train coming their way...</p>

      <p><p>wow I searched up the word on twt and saw there&apos;s discourse ab using it in the first place ðŸ˜­ apparently it&apos;s a new meme buzzword but it comes off prejudice even if the connotations supposedly positive it feels like they&apos;re calling him &quot;a Chinese&quot;.. but yea the sad reality of being a minority they have to be extremely likable to avoid getting racist hate </p></p>
