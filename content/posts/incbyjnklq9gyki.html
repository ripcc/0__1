      <p>sorry coke rant incoming but kr0sins annoying me recently with all the weird
(highkey racist) backhanded compliments they&#x27;re giving jao about being a ì¤‘í‹° or a
ì¤‘ë‚¨ like - saw a fansign clip (that got deleted a couple hrs later at least op
knows shame!) where they&#x27;re like &quot;jao what do u think of ppl calling you a ì¤‘í‹° -
most chinese men kinda hate being called that&quot; and jao&#x27;s like fine i guess i&#x27;ll
take it as a compliment. and some of the engagement with that tweet i saw (incl
from some jaobinists smh) is like &quot;haha so cute he isn&#x27;t offended by it&quot; like
bruh he might not feel offended by it but it doesn&#x27;t make it okay! anyway i rlly
feel for jao (and rikky as well) dealing with xenophobic stereotypes all day
long and having to be like model minority &quot;not like other Chinese guys&quot; on their
best behaviour so they don&#x27;t get a hate train coming their way...</p>

      <p><p>wow I searched up the word on twt and saw there&apos;s discourse ab using it in the first place ðŸ˜­ apparently it&apos;s a new meme buzzword but it comes off prejudice even if the connotations supposedly positive it feels like they&apos;re calling him &quot;a Chinese&quot;.. but yea the sad reality of being a minority they have to be extremely likable to avoid getting racist hate </p></p>
