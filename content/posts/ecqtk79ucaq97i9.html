      <p>im gonna be so real his apology about it was actually good and quick, it seems
like he fr didn&#x27;t realise and even mentioned throwing it away rather than some
bs about fans feeling hurt so ðŸ’€ which is still ignorant but</p>

      <p>Okay but why would a korean man who just got discharged from korean military
announce he&#x27;s pro a right wing party in japan ðŸ’€ not trying to defend him bc
idgaf but it genuinely just sounds like a dumb mistake and he also said he threw
the hat away so</p>

      <p>not that I think that cap actually means anything but the korean military is
aligned with japan &amp; the us the south korean military literally has a clause
that the us can control them at any time during war</p>
