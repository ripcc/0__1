      <p>why does jaos face keep looking like that? he needs to stop overlining his lips,
he already has big lips and wow hair colors really can change people

      <p>but he looks so perfect right now? he had a little weight on during the INVU
cover and that was his only bad look since debut i think he&#x27;s definitely the
type to look better when he&#x27;s skinnier, and he seems like he gains weight super
easily</p>
