      <p>Which is why they have a bad rep among korean kpop fans. Their behavior comes
off as very aggressive and people try to avoid them because they are here for
good vibes. Alot of them are also either brainwashed by cfans or are actual
cfans who can speak korean. You can never trust with what tea they will come to
you because most times its their own speculation 😭😭 How else do you think the
whole new Wak1z thing came to be? This behavior is also one of the reasons why
most kfans dont want chinese members in a group. Most cfans are just too batshit
crazy and think they own everything because they open up their wallet a lil bit
bigger than most 🤷‍♀️ You can always say not all but it will always be most.
Anybody who will try to say thats sinophobic doesnt want to understand the real
problem/concerns. Most korean kpop fans think that idols like Yu9i are great, as
long as my own fav is not in a group with them.</p>

      <p>"among korean kpop fans" nobody cares about a subfandom other than the main
fandom. this anon is just being extremely biased because if we go by your logic
about their aggresive behaviour then every single kpop fandom have a bad rep LOL
"only here for good vibe" is a bullshit because korean fans can be batshit crazy
too, if you've been familiar with korean kpop fans since the second gen you'll
know esp about how the bg stans usually behave in every gens. the fandoms who
have bad rep emong general korean kpop stans are encity (whole esem stans tbh
but there's a reason why koreans call them 씹즈니) and tbzee. i can assure you that
subfandom aint shit the way you're trying to reason to. if how a fandom behaves
is the reason why they dont want to have a certain nationality member in a group
then encity and tbzee will no longer be exist LOL. also it seems to be a fact
that you are just being sinophobic with this🫶 if you know korean you'll know
that korean fans in general are no better than the aggresive fans in your logic</p>
