      <p>Seems some kfans mad af that durian got more screen time than some members and
clock it because why tf was this advertised as zb1 content when a fruit was
shown more than a person. And before the rosins come here and tweak out or even
try and act like itâ€™s ok on x they all know damn well had it been zh that was
cut there would have been trucks infront of that company by morning. I get the
show is focused on the manager but like why tf did they not agree to do this
while they were promoting so that we could actually see the managers managing
and their lives during that time.</p>

      <p>i was asleep so i'm just coming online to read all this now so i could be wrong
since i haven't watched many clips of the actual managers themselves but i
remember when i was more of a carat, 17's manager show was good as fuckkkkkkkk
like i personally found it interesting and i'm pretty sure the 17 members fw
their managers. just went on the youtube video of it now for a refresh, skimmed
a bit and you can see them going to a restaurant at 5am to get the members food,
waking up the members, travelling to the music show, showing their schedule for
the day onscreen etc etc and yet with zbwon i'm not hearing shit about the
managers doing their jobs or being likeable like did they actually do
anything... bc if they showed so much of the managers and they didn't actually
do anything that lowkey makes it worse, especially bc this definitely would've
been scheduled to make their (and jw's with his whole dorm/deadbeat member
situation LMAO) image better ðŸ˜­</p>
