half a million views with 50k+ likes within a day, this is by far the best jb1&#x27;s
youtube show guesting engagement-wise. the salon drip reached 1m+ views in two
weeks and still got less likes than this one. a lot of comments are very
supportive towards jao too, i guess koreans love his durian lore sm. it even
peaked at #4 in youtube s.kor&#x27;s trending videos. too bad this wasnt released
during blue promotion period</p>

      <p>The jaej00ng friends episode trended in Korea Youtube at #7 even though
Jaej00ngs fandom is not as hardcore as popular as 5oobins. It more likely
depends on which shows they visit</p>

      <p>What gp is tuning into Jaej00ngs show? It barely reaches 500k views per episode
and the ones that reach more views than that are videos from months ago ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
We dont have to lie that most Soobs views come from Xtx Intl fans. The only show
the jebes went to and the one that actually has the Gp on the lock from the
begining is Salon Drip.</p>
