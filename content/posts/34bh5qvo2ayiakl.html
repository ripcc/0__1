leader of the trainees, a history nerd, similar vibes of selca, someone even
clock them in qrt the pics are too obvious it is staged by company. sadly some
fall for the propaganda. as they are determined to do it, now they are in
another ~internal conflict like how it was when they decide if they wanna keep
jelliz or housing ibnn. a quite intense one this time i might say. they are
juggling between 3 options, might cut down to 2 options depends on situation,
regarding gw future. all options are dislikeable but depends on how much someone
loves gw, 1 option is tbh the best for him. dislikable, but the best out of the
worse. can only hope that would be the final choice or else, damn</p>
