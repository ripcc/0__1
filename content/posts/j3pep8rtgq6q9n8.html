pretty sure theyre instructed to say this because there&#x27;s some clause with kcon
that you can&#x27;t reveal tour dates in LA until after kcon LA is done so US dates
will only come out after aug</p>

      <p>lolla and coachella have a radius clause but itâ€™s never been confirmed for kcon
besides a couple tweets speculating it just recently. kcon isnâ€™t on their level
anyway I think a radius clause would actually harm them but in my opinion they
simply donâ€™t know the dates yet since this company loves keeping them in the
dark</p>

      <p><p>zbwon are contracted to appear at every major kcon it wouldnt be surprising if there was a radius clause just cuz kcon relies on them so heavily for attendance they headline every single one. but my dramatics and stress got the best of me hrejirththrjekirgjhg i schized out so hard yesterday im kinda embarrassed its most likely smth in planning gwk understand english perfectly well he wouldnt say not yet if he didnt mean it or they didnt know much ab the tour. its in october and theres still yet to be ANY info ab it.......</p></p>
