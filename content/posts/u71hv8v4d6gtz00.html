      <p>anons r actually so stupid ðŸ˜­ its probably some rando that goes to ocsa and ig
thats who theyre talking about? u know shen can have like 3 different chinese
surname characters right? and even if its the same character they probably arent
even related at all ðŸ˜­ I mean we got our own shen xiaoting with the same chinese
character but are they related? no.ðŸ’€ like it makes sense where these 4 step
siblings theories come from bcuz anons be thinking everyone with the same last
name is related to them ðŸ˜­</p>
