      <p>Diff anon but he’s deffo there. He went to birthday cafes with a manager so
that’s how fans knew he was definitely still in a company and one of the other
contestants yichen mentioned seeing him when he went to the dermatologist
(because his (jws) company was right next to it) and the l1ve has like 3
dermatologist right next to it. Plus his trainee place publicly announced that
he passed tl auditions so it deffo makes sense that he’s there. I can see them
revealing him right after zb1 disbanded (if they don’t extend) there’s no point
making him public yet with the expectation of him and other male trainees
debuting with hb when anything could happen in the next year. He’s nice tho and
talented and he seems well liked so a good choice ig.</p>
