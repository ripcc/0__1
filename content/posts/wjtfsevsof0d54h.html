      <p>Why are they asking him about things like that? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Ask him how he has been
or some shit. You are not his manager

      <p>Nooo this fan is cute she's a fancall regular the context is that she's a ww and
zgh stan and he knows that, she did a two truths and a lie and the lie was "i
saw ww today" because she had to do a fancall with zgh so she didn't go see ww's
in person event. So he mentioned that they almost had an event together that op
could have seen them both at instead of choosing between them. Other r*sins will
take it and try to guess the event it was to go start blaming w1 for scheduling
issues but it was just an offhand comment in the fancall not some career
discussion. Cbar admins on the other hand need to di3 today I assume other anons
made asks about them already</p>
