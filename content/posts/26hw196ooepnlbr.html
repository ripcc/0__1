last year when they all got custom mics and they couldnâ€™t use theirs because zh
still hadnâ€™t got his and his c bar as saying itâ€™s taking a while because itâ€™s an
exclusive upgraded custom mic. And then all the other c bar admins got mad
because it made them seem like they were lying to their followers about theirs
being custom too. Well turns out they c bar was just lying and one of the old
people from the cbar was even saying what did they do with all the extra funds
they collected because his mics exactly the same as Matthews and they barely use
theirs custom mics but his crystals were falling off.</p>
