      <p>saw this in another mond but do you think jao has some kinda connection now with
an embc producer or smth because theyâ€™re kinda giving him a few gigs with that
dorm panelist then his drama cameo and now heâ€™s narrating their travel show
considering itâ€™s a korean broadcasting station so theyâ€™re a bit conservative and
all</p>

      <p>This is one of those rare cases where being a foreigner helped him get gigs. The
drama character is taiwanese so hiring a chinese/taiwanese person makes sense,
and the cast of the travel show went on a trip to china so it also makes sense
to have a chinese person do the narration. But I also think he might&#x27;ve gotten
close to an embc pd lol we&#x27;ll see. If they also give him a drama ost then I&#x27;ll
be convinced someone at embc likes him.</p>

      <p>&gt;need a cn or tw actor to play a tw character

&gt;hire zho

&gt;need a cn narrator for a travel show in china

&gt;hire zho

And nothing for rky fr ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ damn nobody wants him or what. Reminds me of
that special knowing bros(? episode with foreigners where mtt and zho went but
rky didn&#x27;t, then there was that jtb&lt; show with foreigners again where everyone
and their mamas went but rky was forgotten once again... like iirc mtt was in
one of the eps as a special guest because zho invited him but what about rky?
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Why didn&#x27;t zho invite him too? Where&#x27;s the cn to cn solidarity?</p>

      <p>idk if you get this but rik feels more american than chinese to me. he doesnt
scream ì¤‘í‹° the way jao does if it makes sense? he acts like asian american kid so
i guess thats why ppl dont think of him when it comes chinese kpop idol? i mean
even his stage name is in english</p>

      <p>as someone friends with chinese ppl and chinese american ppl and besties with
chinese ppl from shanghai who went to high school here in the US i can tell you
that all three of these are wildly different subsets of people ðŸ˜­ but yes
chinese kids who went to HS abroad tend to not have a lot in common with chinese
kids who spent their whole life in china bc their formative hs years were spent
with americans... that&#x27;s also why rky and jao arent close even though theyre
both chinese and should have more in common than the other members. even during
bp rky was mostly friends with the americans like kamd3n j4y etc</p>
