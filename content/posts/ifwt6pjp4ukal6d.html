half a million views with 50k+ likes within a day, this is by far the best jb1&#x27;s
youtube show guesting engagement-wise. the salon drip reached 1m+ views in two
weeks and still got less likes than this one. a lot of comments are very
supportive towards jao too, i guess koreans love his durian lore sm. it even
peaked at #4 in youtube s.kor&#x27;s trending videos. too bad this wasnt released
during blue promotion period</p>

      <p>Girl Soobs show always gets those numbers... He is in XTX?? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I dont know
what you want us to say to that. Get every member on that show and they would
all reach 1Mil like and alot of likes?? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ And yeah even grandpa. Its more
about which shows the boys go to, not what is being talked about</p>
