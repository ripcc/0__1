      <p>You all must be dumb as fuck if you think he chose to perform KICK IT instead of
BAMBI with YJ when there&#x27;s clearly been a push for them as a pair for two years
😭😭 like if they had a cool special stage maybe it would be believable but you
have to be empty headed to not think this is management choicf</p>

      <p><p>ok so YOU wanted him to perform bambi hgjeighjfe the tweak over what you guys think zgh wouldve wanted to do is just stupid even if it was a management choice its a popular duo and these are the 2 same members whove mentioned wanting to do duo stages w eo. liek is it rlly so crazy to think it was suggested and they agreed or its planned? this is all getting framed like zgh got beat up for ever uttering the want for a solo stage and hes being punished by performing with evil bastard hitler yjn... HGJFIGGJFK LIKE YALL GOTTA CHILL theyre doing smth related to bp for their anniv and just say u didnt like it rather than think there was a gun to zghs head to perform this everyone did smth that was obviously a choice </p></p>
