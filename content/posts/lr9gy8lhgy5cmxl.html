      <p>lmaooooooo i thought the mv looked like an ad. they did have that yoncÃ© ot7
predebut dance evaluation video and that one cl lil kim cover tho and i do feel
like some of the predebut covers are new since i didn't see anyone saying they'd
seen it despite how crazy blinks go over those types of contents</p>
