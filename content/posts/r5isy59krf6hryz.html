      <p>Hi I joined her friends Tai GO and I got my items but like 8 months later ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I
realized both gothsunghoon and lesbi/Tai doesn&#x27;t &quot;host&quot; go on those insta
accounts anymore. But apparently Shelby won a recent zb1 fansign/fancall and how
could she do that if she&#x27;s not hosting elsewhere? Apparently she&#x27;s in South
Korea now and I heard she posts on xhs instead. Either way people need to get
her investigated because $11k ems is ridiculous.</p>
