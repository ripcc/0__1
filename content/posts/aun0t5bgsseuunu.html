      <p>Anon Iâ€™ll actually crash out if itâ€™s true, i lurk in solo spaces and they even
talk on his solos pages how they donâ€™t want it. I doubt itâ€™s happening since he
has mca and wswf and they are actually going to run him to the ground, thereâ€™s
no way heâ€™s going to have time for a 3rd ntm itâ€™s just evil as fuck when you
know this group depressed as hell that they are getting replaced</p>
