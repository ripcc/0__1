      <p>Bnd getting dragged so bad on weibo ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ apparently their concert in Bangkok got
cancelled due to the earthquake and they didn&#x27;t notify the fans or say anything,
they quietly and quickly just flew back to Seoul without letting the fans know
so that they don&#x27;t have more competition for plane tickets since everyone is
trying to get out of there</p>
