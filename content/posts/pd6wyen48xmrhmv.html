      <p>this is an honest question out of curiosity and not akgae shit. What do you
think is the reason why Hao is not being pushed in Japan when he&#x27;s the best
seller and Gunhao are still the most popular there but at least gunwook is
getting bags but hao still has no solo or unit projects in japan? He can also
speak the laguage. I&#x27;m trying to understand why with so much logic. So far we
have Matt, wookie, hanbin and jiwoong who were given exposure in japan shows. Do
you think it&#x27;s sinophobia?</p>

      <p><p>well simple answer is that you could count the amount of jpn schedules outside the group and it would be single digits and zgh already has a focus on chn solo scheds. mcing doesnt count here since its a skill thing + mnet hiring hbn whos their mc. its just jarring to care ab this no shade like why do we need solo/unit schedules for everything they do promo right with their japan stuff which is majority group activities ðŸ˜­ like this is pretty rare to begin w and gwk/mtts schedule suits them ig this is a first world zrose issue </p></p>

      <p>no not the mc in music festivals but the appearance in japanese shows and
magazine. hanbin was the first last year where he talked about kpop then wookie
and uncs for the magazine. matt for that cooking show and another show with
wookie. im curious why lapone isn&#x27;t giving hao a var show too. im thinking its
because hes chinese. japanese are also sinophobic but subtle about it</p>

      <p>Do you mean Hanbin&#x27;s interview for DIMA promotion?

It had nothing to do with the group, wk1 or mnet</p>
