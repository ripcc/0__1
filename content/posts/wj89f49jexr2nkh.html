      <p>Thats not his room ðŸ˜­ idk how to explain it basically his fans pulled a haknye0n
and overexagerrated about doing this and that (breaking into his room and taking
his water bottles) and were bragging about it on douyin not knowing some other
fans actually DID break into their rooms so the ris started getting attention
and hate and was threaten to face legal consequences so she backtracked and said
she lied to brag but she did take the waterbottles from the fansign but that was
it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ so that was her room and her stuff except the water bottles but
again some other crazy bitches did break into their rooms and those pictures
with with the food are real ðŸ’€</p>
