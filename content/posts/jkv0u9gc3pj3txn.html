      <p>all of them lurk on xhs and weibo to get tea to drag the other one so it&#x27;s safe
to say they have selective vision for a lot of things</p>

      <p>nah as someone who does entertain the idea of jaobin being real Idk where this
idea that chinese jao fans think jaobin is real came from? believe it or not a
lot of chinese jao fans don&#x27;t even think he&#x27;s gay and even believed him when he
was joking around saying that he&#x27;s motae solo ðŸ˜­ they&#x27;re all gf stans. even the
chinese jao fans who do think he&#x27;s gay including the hardcore ones who dig a lot
into his past don&#x27;t think jaobin is real. i&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re right there&#x27;s
definitely selective vision going on and i don&#x27;t think it changes what we think
of jaobin that&#x27;s just the overall perception over there it&#x27;s very similar to
kfan mentality except with additional akgaeism added that would make people even
less likely to call it real</p>
