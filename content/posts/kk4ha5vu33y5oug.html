      <p>is there any other new/recent zbwon tea or have we exhausted it all? the mt gf
thing made me hungry for me and i was already craving lmaoooooooo. surely
someone&#x27;s spotted them out and about doing shit or they&#x27;re more lax now that
they&#x27;re doing fuck all ðŸ˜­



but on the topic of mt, a few days ago i saw a screenshot on the korean side
(lost the tweet soz) that was someone on his plus chat live with the cat
basically commenting about how mt&#x27;s disappointing them and when i saw that i
thought it was solely about him getting a cat since it feels like he now has
time to do that as zbwon are clearly slowing down and who knows what his
post-zbwon career will be but now that i think about it maybe the fan knew or
could even just feel he got a gf and was looking after the cat with her ðŸ¤”</p>

      <p>it is now deleted that is why you canâ€™t see it anymore but that was a gyub
biased zerooose and all of m4ttâ€™s fans were ganging up on her so idt that has
anything to do with it and if it does then that fan needs to concern herself
with her bias dating first and then m4tt</p>
