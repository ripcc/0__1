      <p>it was best fancon but i don‚Äôt why they didn‚Äôt have hao and Yujin solo maybe
time consuming or because hao got solo during concert but it was good. I think
even best than cincert</p>

      <p>I mean tbh the members all probably had a set time to do a solo stage each
because the song choices reflected what I think they would have chosen too and
it just so happens lkyz have been very vocal about wanting to do smth together.
They were probably the ones that suggested the duo stage together or even yh but
I doubt wk1 was a driving force behinds them doing it üò≠</p>
