      <p>tbh the first difference that soob has with bg is that you can see that every
friend that he has (jao, ar1n, epipen members) talk about how soob is a shitty
texter, but he said that he talks with beomgyu everyday and during his hiatus
there wasn&#x27;t a day on where he and BG wouldn&#x27;t text.

      <p>Not sayinh that&#x27;s the case for them, but looking at the industry and groups,
it&#x27;s more likely people have crushes/feelings for their groupmates than them
being together/being reciprocated</p>
