      <p>Although if I were a cr*sin I would be calling the police right now....one of
the head admins (and the most notorious one) is in Japan right now and I
wouldn't be surprised if she's fled with her monies and the rest are all on
their way out. They shut down the r*sin shop also and everything's stuck in
limbo and the r*sins are still trying to wrangle out details and ledgers.
They're giving them too much time to pull their funds and flee the country. Once
they pull funds all that's left is to nuke their accs and then it's gonna be
difficult to get their monies back.</p>
