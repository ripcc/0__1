      <p>I think yhz are actually cooked even if they get 4 members in the group because
both bopeuI2 and soomaan25 are targeting cfans and soomaan already has several
trainees that are extremely popular there. I don&#x27;t want to say this but I think
the chances of yh being able to promote the boys better than soomaan is 0. 1V3
didn&#x27;t even have to compete with a soomaan group, just HYVE which didn&#x27;t have
the gg knowhow they have now. Yhz had the upper hand in sales but with all those
giant cbars of the rookies, idk anymore. It&#x27;s a big group too and they&#x27;re
debuting at the end of the year so they will have a head start on sales while
Yhz are still locked up until january. BopeuI2 is going to have a whopping 14
motherfucking members. Even if each individual member doesn&#x27;t sell as much as
h40, it&#x27;s easier to have overwhelming physical sales with 14 individual
fanbases, not to mention the survashow adrenaline hike to beat out the previous
seasons&#x27; sales will be there. All of those trainees are also more &quot;fresh&quot; than 4
members of ZB1 that have already been in the public eye for 2.5 years. Those two
should be their main competitors but then there&#x27;s also YG&#x27;s boy group. I have a
feeling BL&#x27;s co-ed group is actually a stunt to promote the yg bg members.
Anyways, the end of this year and next year is about to get real competitive and
I&#x27;m not ready. Also all of these companies are targeting china and succeeding to
some extent so that means yhz competitive advantage is actually not that high.</p>
