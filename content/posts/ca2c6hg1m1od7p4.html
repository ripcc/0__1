      <p>I could think of a few scenerios:



1)They&#x27;re either probably going to show how he dorms with the manager

2) or the &quot;room&quot; he stays at when they have promotions

3) or randomly creates a room for him to stay

4) or flat out say he doesn&#x27;t live there (which might be unlikely since the
whole show is suppose to reveal how jebis live in dorms and their dynamics ðŸ¤”)</p>

      <p><p>why do i feel like no matter how much we try to guess whatever they end up doing is gonna be so left field ðŸ˜­ in my head i imagine his apartments close enough to theirs so he doesnt stay w them during promotions. cuz theres never been signs hes stepped foot in that place tbhhhh</p></p>

      <p>4 is possible only if wk1 asks for the script not to go into jw being outside
the dorm too deep. triples member also lives at home bc she goes university and
they mentioned this for one second, and joined with the members at their
hairshop</p>
