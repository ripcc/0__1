      <p>more and more i keep seeing people say that they want to say shit but can&#x27;t
reveal their opinions or tea til after zbwon disbandment and listen i am gonna
be devastated by the group ending even if we&#x27;ve all been abused but at the same
time LET ME IN I WANT TO KNOW THESE CONTROVERSIAL TAKES AND INFORMATIONNNNNNNNN

probably mean something like &quot;the members aren&#x27;t close to rk and in fact some of
them probably dislike him&quot; girl we know that</p>
