      <p>i think they probably meant who of the zroses will stay following any of the
members at all bc i don&#x27;t expect ppl to stan/follow every single member since
that feels a bit unrealistic with them all split into different careers and some
of those just won&#x27;t be interesting most likely ðŸ˜­ i sent an ask like this before
but with w1 they don&#x27;t fuck with j4ehwan, don&#x27;t care about lots of the others
and seem to keep up with..... idk...... p4rk j1hoon i guess but i swear they
abandoned all of them except for c1x and maybe ab61x for a little bit. with
iz0ne they didn&#x27;t really care about most of the soloists or japanese members.
with zbwon they&#x27;ll probably follow yhz and hb, leave jw and tr, then whatever mt
and gw&#x27;s got going on they might follow. but yeah i can also see zroses just
moving on to completely new bgs, while some have zbwon as a last kpop group
(other than possibly their bias&#x27;/few other members&#x27; post-disbandment path) and
dgaf anymore there are others who still seem very active in the fan culture and
are big multis so they&#x27;ll be sad for a bit and then forget the members ever
existed until being reminded every few months from some tweet or tiktok and
leaving a comment like &quot;omg i miss zbwon they could&#x27;ve been so big what are they
up to now&quot;</p>
