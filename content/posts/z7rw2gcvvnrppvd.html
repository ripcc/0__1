      <p>i'm seeing these bp2 posts now that these trainee pics are out and the amount of
ex-bp and other survival show contestants as well as nugu bg members ðŸ˜­ they're
under different circumstances obv but i'm wondering if zbwon would join yet
another survival show down the line when their group/solo careers are flopping
in a few years time lmao like i remember zh said he wanted to go on a survival
show again and lbr most if not all of their prospects look like shit so i can
see some of them doing it (not jw bc bp was already that for him and he'll be in
the military)... they'll be the oldest among them all but like uncs still got it</p>
