      <p>honestly I really hope there&#x27;s at least post-zebewan group outside of yuehhz to
have multiple members. Going the exwan route where every other member debuts in
a new group as the face will just bound to be real nugu, if any members can team
up together like Matt and gwk it would at least be a group that can float. Post
bp groups have been benefiting off this too</p>
