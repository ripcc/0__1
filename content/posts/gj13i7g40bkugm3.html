      <p>no but seriously does he think that associating with hb this much will make us
think heâ€™s an impeccable person with an immaculate character or wtv because it
just feels desperate instead like just be normaaaal</p>

      <p>In my head hbn sees him as a younger brother and the fact they live together and
are always in close proximity ads to that and gv sees him as the older brother
he doesnâ€™t have ? What is he like the oldest of 5 and i remember him saying smth
all the way back in bp that he cried after the star level test and hb hugged him
even though they didnâ€™t know eachother and like gv was even saying back then he
wants to live with him and repay him so i guess he really got that idolised big
brother role</p>
