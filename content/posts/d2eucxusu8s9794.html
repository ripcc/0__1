      <p>i wish jaobin was terrorising ot9 content and that they were being milked, this
is a rarity considering they usually don&#x27;t even show them interacting like
normal kpop idols who debuted in the same group. more of this please to make up
for all the lost opportunities actually</p>

      <p>i&#x27;m sorry but i don&#x27;t get this &quot;rarity&quot;, like, out of the members, i&#x27;m sure wk1
showed jao&#x27;s interactions with hbn the most? and they often got paired together
for stuff too (basically the government ship?)ðŸ˜­ i mean, hbn did interact with
other members a lot esp gyuv but if you focus on jao more, you&#x27;ll see that hbn
is the member he interacts more. the second one will be gyuv or yjn but there&#x27;s
a big gap. for references, you may check jaobin/gyuvjao/yjnjao duo account and
see the difference in the amount of interactions they have. so what exactly is
this rarity about? if anything, jao doesn&#x27;t interact much with other members in
comparison</p>

      <p><p>bottom line is this is never feeling like a rarity unless ur tapped into them cuz i think its fine outside of zepisodes. theres also the popularity argument which is true the expectation for getting paired up is higher but its not like its barelandia were gonna see the mix of members who get <u>content</u> schedules the most and theres a disparity between zgh and hbn to begin w </p></p>
