      <p>Nah his company have a lot of older male trainees around his age that a few of
us know about and that wouldnâ€™t make any sense at all unless they were making a
group for home plus they only started going to older males once he debuted in
zbone. People just discuss njw because he was public but there are a lot of
other trainees in that company now. He probably will do some solo stuff on the
side but there will deffo be a group waiting for him.</p>

      <p><p>idk if I&apos;m rmbring incorrectly but they opened auditions way back when and the starting age was 2001 or smth which is uncommon so honestly I think he&apos;s debuting in a group too. I used to think he&apos;d wing it solo (not necessarily a music artist) but the realities always been that that works out for nobody and his company would prob want him to continue to be profitable </p></p>

      <p>Yeah their audition age used to be in line with the normal 2006 and Iâ€™m pretty
sure their female audition age is still around that but after hbns debut it got
lowered to 2001. So in regard to that other anons ask about them just doing
