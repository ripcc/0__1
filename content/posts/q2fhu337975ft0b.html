      <p>I never actually thought of the possibility that they would extend but not
jebeone. Like wtf is tartar supposed to go back too and a yhz group with 4
popular idols and some unknown trainees makes no sense, maybe it they had 1/2
yhz but 4 and some who’ve never been in the public eye can’t go well ?
