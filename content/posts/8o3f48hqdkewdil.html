      <p>so happy with the jaobin + uncle unit calls jaobin were having the damn time of
their lives while uncs was third wheeling and looking weird as hell like yassss
i always want him to be uncomfortable as fuck! also killed me how he looked so
awkward during the fanservice poses even the normal ones that he was included in
like he does yaoi shit for a living but jaobin looked way more natural than him
literally what is wrong with him</p>
