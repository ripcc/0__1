      <p>i think itâ€™s gone because there was a bit of a misinfo basically they didnâ€™t
make a new scent it was released back in 2024 and i guess the name sounded like
0se so they went with it theyâ€™re just doing a collab with him rn to promote it
in korea ig but regardless itâ€™s still good for him</p>
