      <p><p>right and this is the case for like every group ever jfans always get these special events that everyone would die over ðŸ˜­ I think it&apos;s cuz kr is too much of home base + could receive scrutiny and every other fan is chopped liver </p></p>

      <p><p>They&apos;re actually easier and cheaper to do than real fansigns the expensive shit is the polaroids. I talked to some cfan who&apos;s been it&apos;s way easier to get in according to her and they do a bunchhhh of ppl so it makes sense it&apos;s basically longer hitouch </p></p>

      <p>i mean i live in japan and ive failed for every single event ðŸ’€ you get an entry
with each album you buy but its complete chance bc it randomly generates a
number for each one and you have to enter it in on this site where it
immediately tells you if its a win or a loss, ive wasted sooo much money but tbh
it probably is easier than the thousands people buy to get into korean events</p>
