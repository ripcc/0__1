      <p>i feel like so many zroses are starting to stan n*t w*sh or &amp;t**m these days and
i just dc like how can u abandon these impoverished children with nothing going
for them zbwon please do something interesting quick u already lost them even
tho u were just active with the fancon



what&#x27;s annoying is i just listened to some n*t w*sh songs for the first time and
i kinda get the hype so i can&#x27;t fully hate. like poppop is a better executed
feel the pop (production/mixing + concept wise, i know they&#x27;re otherwise not
really alike sonically) LMAO</p>

      <p><p>the only better thing ab wishs song is their execution so ur right but no shade their title is so terrible i already grew to love ftp but i had to appreciate it wishs chorus is just all over the place. I get it tho they appeal to their audience really well and their team executes their concept and schedule flawlessly I&apos;m jealous but ehhh the zroses that get into andt were already hype fans cuz no shade they&apos;re just nha rejects and full of filler members</p></p>

      <p>i have heard so much about w1sh but never anything about their music, they&#x27;re
lowkey the same as zbwon were people talk more bout the yaoi and tiktok than the
actual music</p>
