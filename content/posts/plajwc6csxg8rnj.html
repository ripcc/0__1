      <p>I think someone spread the wrong info about this being akaraka the one they&#x27;re
attending is yonseis anniversary festival akaraka is yonseis prestigious
festival and that ones line up is never revealed till the day of the festival
and it&#x27;s usually only super popular idols</p>

      <p>OMG YALLLLL I DID NOT MEAN ALL THAT JB1 LITERALLY MY KINGS i just saw someone
correct it on the tl so I wanted to point it out but this is akaraka too it&#x27;s
the dongmu (almuni) akaraka and it&#x27;s also very prestigious but it&#x27;s diff from
the main festival that happens in may that one only has people like aspa or 1ve
or like big company groups and they keep their line up hidden to build up
anticipation THATS IT I SWEARRR</p>
