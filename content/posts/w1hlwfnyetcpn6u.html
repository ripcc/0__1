Then a picture of nton holding a girls hand came out her face was censored and we couldn&apos;t see the caption ALL HELL STARTED TO BREAK LOOSE. THEN a picture of shee kissing a guy on the cheek released it&apos;s nothing incriminating but it&apos;s just troll material and shee was already an internet target. That was it for a while and people just kept referencing the prior chat ss in whispers but not everyone saw it just cuz this alll dropped at 4-5 am in korea.</p><p></p><p>So no ender material there but then someone reposted the text messages and it was soooo detailed, it was explaining eunseoks gf and who she is, (theonly, she&apos;s infamous in creating rumors and having idol connections AND IS FRIENDS WITH HAN SHEE.. linked to a crime ring btw) her conversations with eseok from Feb 2024 that detailed when they broke up (2022-early 2023) and when they stopped hanging out, Nov 2023. She was basically trying to put the infamous han shee on with schan or wbin and she texted eseok to do it for her. eseok was like I&apos;ll try but I can&apos;t guarantee that they&apos;ll want to they&apos;re not looking to date rn. This is where the wbin 168cm joke comes from cuz eseoks gf/ex theonly/dionlee (again very known) told hsh this and she was like &quot;HELLLL NAHHHH I don&apos;t want him&quot; these are from screenshots of a gc where theonly is retelling to girls and having a kii about it, pretty sure she shaded him on her story too lol. More of her ig stories got leaked and she would call shee ugly and names all the time too. There was a lot more with hsh and hjin from sks it was just pitiful rlly but we don&apos;t care ab sks so I&apos;ll skip. Then a leaker who&apos;s from hsh and theonlys circle was talking about how she came to date eseok. Just to give content this leaker came on an egg account posting proof they were ex friends with theonly they also posted screenshots of her blowing up their dm and threatening to sue LOL. So theonly lied ab being a chaebol and she basically made it her goal in life to date an idol, she worked hard to make connections and even when to Hanlim high with no real reason to. When eseok found out she lied her way into dating him so he tried to break it off and she was like actually I&apos;m pregnant so he FREAKED OUT. he sent her abortion money and everything idk if he found out she lied or not but somehow they stayed on good terms. This all came from one source who knows how much of is it true but it didn&apos;t come from hsh herself and for a shit stirrer who&apos;s tried to get riice in trbl before she was real pressed ab this and threatened to sue op. A lot of kbriices who saw it at the time believed it especially the timestamps matched up with activity, theonlys stories that had a mysterious man in them matching eseoks clothes, and the sks hjin story matching other rumors and timestamps. </p><p></p><p>Back to nton, because fans were trying to find the ig where the hand holding pic came from they stumbled upon a public page of a girl named allegraiim. NOW we know that picture of the girl was not the his gf (allegras his gf lol) but Anton&apos;s cousin who posted on a private ig. But them being nosy led to them actually discovering the real gf. There was evidence suggesting that they&apos;ve been dating since 2019ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. She even drew his dad and his brother lmao it was crazy then they found his burner... well that&apos;s completely my fault forgive me nton ðŸ˜«. And then they found his 90 other finstas and burners so that&apos;s all. I was so jobless and stayed up to see everything unfold idc it was worth itttttt you can go on pchoa to find photos but the way this had people making hit tweets ab ntons finstas and how he was deleting them in real time mcbjenfkcjndxmdn it was a tiiiime riice had to go on live and apologize for all this and lowkey it killed a lot of their kfandom </p>"}

      <p><p>They&apos;ve been getting whipped and tortured for 311 so they&apos;re def on good behavior now but all I can think of is the schan uriboo lore that led to people finding out that he and nst jwoo using to go to hunting clubs or smth idk if I believe that tbh. also apparently eseok brought his ex?/her friends? to their encore and put them in the family section and fans went mad </p></p>
