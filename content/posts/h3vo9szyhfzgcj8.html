      <p>I get surprised that my oomfs are more updated than me on zhg pc and they dont
even subscribe to him like that i was scrolling through haotexts page and they
get really good engagements his pics get 10k likes regularly i feel if we have a
centralized acc like this for all the members in one its easier for even casual
stans to get updates like the one nctdream or aespa has
