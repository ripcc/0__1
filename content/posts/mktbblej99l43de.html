      <p>it feel like blue was forever ago despite the fact the comeback was only just
over 2 months ago ðŸ˜­ i&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s bc of the lack of content bc we should
be swimming in it, especially when it comes to promos.. i saw a tweet that
apparently mt said they spoiled the full album too early which means it must be
a few more months til it yet and i was thinking &quot;why tho, the last comeback was
so long ago&quot; but then i check the dates and it wasn&#x27;t???????? it&#x27;s sickkkkkkkkkk</p>
