      <p>i&#x27;m seeing these bp2 posts now that these trainee pics are out and the amount of
ex-bp and other survival show contestants as well as nugu bg members ðŸ˜­ they&#x27;re
under different circumstances obv but i&#x27;m wondering if zbwon would join yet
another survival show down the line when their group/solo careers are flopping
in a few years time lmao like i remember zh said he wanted to go on a survival
show again and lbr most if not all of their prospects look like shit so i can
see some of them doing it (not jw bc bp was already that for him and he&#x27;ll be in
the military)... they&#x27;ll be the oldest among them all but like uncs still got it</p>
