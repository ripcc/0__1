pretty sure theyre instructed to say this because there&#x27;s some clause with kcon
that you can&#x27;t reveal tour dates in LA until after kcon LA is done so US dates
will only come out after aug</p>

      <p>that doesnt make sense tho cuz both kcon and jb1&#x27;s tour are handled by CJ, if
its another agency&#x27;s artist then its understandable but why would they do this
to their own artist like shouldnt it be profitable to make their own artist&#x27;s
tour more successful than the kcon? by making the member said theres no US
dates, it basically killed the fans&#x27; expectation so if they suddenly announce
the US dates after kcon then many fans wouldnt be prepared for it since they
knew they wouldnt have US tour anyway which means there&#x27;ll be less attendees?</p>
