      <p>Same gym rat anon - after writing about how goated Wookie's physique is I got
inspired to do this. I'mma very subjectively rank the members on how good their
body type would be for gym growth and aesthetics. Basically, ranking them on if
they have a good body type for muscle growth and proportionality.



1. Wooks got the best body for sure, for reasons I already described. Basically,
goated frame, height, proportionality. Above average foundation, even beyond
idols and beyond most men globally.

2. Rky is second. His body type is also good but not as proportional due to long
neck and face length + slightly sloped shoulders. Still, the muscles he has
gained sit nicely on him.

3. Mtw is third. Some might say he's the most fit currently and I'd agree but
he's still below the other two because of his height. If he gets super buff he
might look stumpy or shorter and it wouldn't look that even. Still, his face
size matches his body type and he doesn't objectively look off. And he can
obviously grow muscle relatively easily. Just a little nerfed from going
further.

4. Hbin is fourth. Nothing too bad and nothing too remarkable. Good chest/torso
potential though.

5. Jao is fifth. His body is pretty standard but his reliance on shoulder pads
makes me think he struggles with trying to build muscle or strength there. They
also aren't naturally wide, so there's not much of a remarkable foundation to
work with. It's all, dare I say, standard for a male kpop idol. Nothing that
makes him a unique candidate for growth or aesthetic.

6. Gyv is sixth. Yes he got the height and lanky limbs but I think if he gets
buff his head would look even smaller and be a little unbalanced. His face is so
small that I think his current frame best suits it tbh. Aesthetically, for these
reasons, he shouldn't get buffer, but if we didn't incorporate his head size I
think he'd be second. He has wide shoulders, and despite having long af legs his
torso matches proportionally. Plus he's lowkey built already and has a good
foundation. He really does have a unique body type a lot of models would love to
have.

7. Yjn is eighth. He has super narrow hips - like narrow narrow. He's overall
thinner than most idols (not talking about weight but rather the width of his
frame and pelvis). I think if he gets buff it'd might be top heavy and
inadvertently push attention to his hips too much to where people would notice
the disproportional or untypical thin size.

8. & 9. The last ones are a tie between Tr and Jw. Yes JW is already buff but he
has narrow shoulders and short arm length, so it looks stocky on him. If you
look at a picture of him rn his arms look super short compared to the rest of
him. Tr's upper body would look better than JW if he ever became a gym rat but
his veryy short legs would compromise the overall picture and make him look
top-heavy. Both are here primarily due to bone length and they are both pretty
short. The reason Mtw is way higher despite being shorter is because his face
and body look more even and his short bones don't stick out as much as the other
two.



TLDR: Wooks goated, Gyv is a wild card due to face size and if you think it
matters, Yjn skinnyyyy, and Tr&Jw short height and bonee length. Mtw lowkey
blessed with proportions, Rcky good, and Jao/Hbn meh.</p>
