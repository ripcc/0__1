      <p>Pray my bias doesn’t become a soloist because I’ve already tried to stan soloist
and it’s not fun. 99% sure his companies preparing a group for him, so I just
gotta pray it’s good vibes because I’m not dropping him 😭</p>

      <p>which is exactly why I don&#x27;t get akgaes.. stanning a singular person in
kindustry is soooooo boring the best way to get to know someone is through
multiple human interactions idk I need that parasocial tea</p>

      <p>i think akgaes know that too, they&#x27;re just schizo. like they could totally get
the solo experience they talk about wanting by stanning an actual soloist. they
wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with &#x27;leech&#x27; members and i don&#x27;t think the actual idol
they&#x27;re stanning really matters that much to them since they&#x27;re so success based
BUT they&#x27;d find that too boring and even non-akgaes do too clearly, very few
soloists seem to have dedicated fanbases, so they stick to stanning an idol in a
group like bro go home</p>
