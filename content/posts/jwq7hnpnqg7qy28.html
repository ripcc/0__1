      <p>idk where you&#x27;re on anon but i&#x27;m obviously not talking about specific posts lmao
i&#x27;m in a lot of crosin gcs including some an admin of zgh bar ðŸ˜­ also i&#x27;m the og
anon not the one that said you would know everything on the cside. but yeah lmao
it&#x27;s still pretty common knowledge from what i&#x27;ve seen that his contract ends
soon and he was never gonna be in the yhz group anyways that was planned before
he even joined the company where have y&#x27;all been brother</p>

      <p>Nta, idk anything about their contracts I&#x27;m just curious but I assumed they all
signed trainee contracts and only sign exclusive artist contracts after
disbandment? Since jao said he only joined yh for bp, he could&#x27;ve signed the
shortest trainee contract and the insider info could be true. Hmm but wouldn&#x27;t
the boys also have signed new contracts after bp? They must&#x27;ve had to negotiate
their salaries and the % of profit they&#x27;d get from albums, endorsements and
other stuff with their og companies, no? Anon, pls share more info if you can.</p>

      <p><p>I originally thought they only signed trainee contracts but we agreed a longgggg time ago they all probably signed artist contracts at formation. Obv nobody knows it&apos;s purely speculative but yea I feel like the reasoning just isn&apos;t getting to me </p></p>
