      <p>idk where you're on anon but i'm obviously not talking about specific posts lmao
i'm in a lot of crosin gcs including some an admin of zgh bar ðŸ˜­ also i'm the og
anon not the one that said you would know everything on the cside. but yeah lmao
it's still pretty common knowledge from what i've seen that his contract ends
soon and he was never gonna be in the yhz group anyways that was planned before
he even joined the company where have y'all been brother</p>

      <p>Nta, idk anything about their contracts I'm just curious but I assumed they all
signed trainee contracts and only sign exclusive artist contracts after
disbandment? Since jao said he only joined yh for bp, he could've signed the
shortest trainee contract and the insider info could be true. Hmm but wouldn't
the boys also have signed new contracts after bp? They must've had to negotiate
their salaries and the % of profit they'd get from albums, endorsements and
other stuff with their og companies, no? Anon, pls share more info if you can.</p>
