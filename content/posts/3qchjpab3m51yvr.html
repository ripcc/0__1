      <p>Sorry to ruin the fun but no it&#x27;s not his, it&#x27;s two separate posts combined into
one. p2 is comment section of p3&amp;4 which were posted by chinese zeroses on xhs
who broke into their rooms after they left with all the left over food where
it&#x27;s daytime and talking shit about how wasteful they are.

P1 is talking about p5 6&amp;7 are chinese ris who took rk&#x27;s water bottles from the
fansign after it was over and drank from it in their own hotel room, not his
room and she posted it on douyin. If you saw the ris douyin before she deleted
it she lives and studies in korea and there&#x27;s pictures of her smoking so it&#x27;s
hers. The weibo post censored her face but in her post she didnt censor it so
she got doxxed hence deleting her douyin but before she deleted it she made a
comment in the og post clarifying it was her own room she was in, how her group
of ris friends were not the one who actually broke into the jebis rooms but she
did try searching for his room but couldn&#x27;t find it so this group of ris weren&#x27;t
friends with the c zeroses who actually broke in. Basically she didn&#x27;t want to
get in trouble for breaking and entering because her face wasn&#x27;t censored so she
clarified.</p>
