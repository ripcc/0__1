      <p>history is repeating itself fr... i watched all the produce seasons while they
were airing (except gp/bp lol i watched bp after getting into zbwon bc pdx was
so disappointing) and i loved w1 but the ex1 lineup sucked and we all complained
that it should&#x27;ve been w1 with the 5 year contract now its the same thing lmaoo</p>

      <p>I don&#x27;t think zer0ses will give this new show/group as much attention as y&#x27;all
think. With w1 ppl moved onto ex1 easily cause the group was gone and settled
into their nugu groups by then. Bc both zebewan and the show will be promoting
at the same time active zer0ses will still harbour shit against the group and
they won&#x27;t hype up the show intl as much as bepl1. Mind you if everyone intlly
was a svs addict like they say, those many svs that were released this year
would be hyped. Now k side is a diff story... emnetneeds to just provide good
looking men and that&#x27;s about it.</p>
