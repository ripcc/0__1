      <p>Someone in your replies said callins will surpass hao&#x27;s sales. Man... I don&#x27;t
think they can realistically reach 9 million yuan, that&#x27;s like 1.2 million
dollars and most kallins and iallins have no idea about the cmag yet which means
they aren&#x27;t saving. I could be wrong here but I&#x27;m pretty sure a lot of callins
left last year or at least aren&#x27;t as active as they used to be. Hanbin used to
be the third most popular member in china in 2023 but now he&#x27;s almost the fifth
and frankly I don&#x27;t understand why because he&#x27;s had a lot of activities that
allowed him to showcase his talents and charms like AOTM but he still lost
cfans. Anyway, I can see them reaching 3.5 million yuan if they save diligently
until june and receive a lot of donations from kallins and iallins, but maybe 3
million yuan is a more realistic goal. As a reference, cris had one month to
save money and 7 days to buy his mag (not 24h like all of hao&#x27;s cmags) and
reached 3.5 million yuan. This was right after the Keep Running hype aka ricky&#x27;s
peak popularity in china, but callins have 3 months to prepare, heck maybe even
more because his cbar knew about the mag since november, so who knows? But they
aren&#x27;t reaching 9 million.</p>

      <p><p>i saw that comment and just ignored not my forte lollllll but right 3 months of saving from a smaller fandom wont match up to big fandom schizomoves. ive been seeing the debate of gyuvins place for 4th when it comes to china and im ngl it seems clearer these days so yea surpassing hao is probably not happening</p></p>

      <p>1. callins are almost all akgaes and tired of the group

 2. yuehuaz probably attract more dedicated cfans bcs their chinese company idk

 3. plus you know cfans are obsessed with idols who was born pretty and thin
    
    and even now when hb is considered as one of the visuals in the group people
    will always mock him for his past</p>
