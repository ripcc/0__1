      <p>idek if I want to tweak over the 5 year contract because while I love jb1 so
much the concept of having to be under wk1 forgot 5 years sounds exhausting but
a small part of me is scared that they&#x27;ll be using all of the money they got
from jb1 and treating them better since they&#x27;re staying with them longer THE
THOUGHT OF THIS HAS ME ACTUALLY KILLING MYSELF IN ADVANCE IT IS SO UNFAIR AND
HEARTBREAKING</p>
