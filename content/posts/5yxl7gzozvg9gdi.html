      <p><p>disappointment isn&apos;t coming from the majority and it&apos;s not lasting that long anyways. I don&apos;t think he should expect the worst out of his fans for smth they&apos;ve been preparing </p></p>

      <p>sorry but literally what the hell are you talking about anon? ðŸ˜­ he was smiling
and doing fanservice throughout the whole thing and so many fans talked about
his energy today especially during the encore but if ur talking about nerves
everyone was nervous which is normal? like i genuinely don&#x27;t understand why
everything about him has to be overanalyzed to this extent it&#x27;s never done with
other members, and he always has to think 27272829 times about every possible
outcome before he says or does anything like it&#x27;s getting mad annoying tbfh</p>
