      <p>how did they manage to pick the most vocally challenged members ðŸ˜­ can they
cancel this and release an ost with the other 5 since theyâ€™re the ones who can
actually sing</p>

      <p>this is one of the issues of wk1 though is that they absolutely do not know hoto
play to peoples strengths or probably they just dgaf. like idk itâ€™s fine if not
everyone gets an ost itâ€™s fine if not everyone gets a dance break give them to
the people who actually have talent and will make them somewhat interesting</p>
