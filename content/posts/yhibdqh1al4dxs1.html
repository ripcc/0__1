      <p>one observation ive made about jb1 is that ALL the members are known somewhat
even to non bp watchers in the intl side (as opposed to other 5th gen bgs where
only a few of them are known)



now I could just be saying this cause im more around jb1 likers but I don&#x27;t
think it&#x27;s far fetched to say that every single member is known to some capacity
in the non fan kpop space



like ppl obviously know rky jwg jao janbin and now mtw is pretty much on their
levels gwk gyv are pretty well known too ive seen lots of twts tiktoks reels
with even tr and yjn having big interactions too</p>
