      <p>are you guys forgetting that only han8in has been gettting the cream of the crop
ceejay gigs? yu3hua is the one who got yooj1n ink1 because they have connections
with 585. wak1 didn't do anything for them. hb is their industry plant baby just
like that gunu kid is.</p>

      <p>The day you anons learn what an industry plant is, is the day we learn peace.
You can say hb is favoured and weâ€™d all agree but thatâ€™s not the same thing as
an industry plant at all ðŸ˜‚ and it still doesnâ€™t mean what of anon said isnâ€™t
true. Like yh and cj BEEN having a good relationship, they have worked together
multiple times now and if they were willing to work together to have bp2 centred
around their own trainees clearly there was a tie there but both cj and yh were
greedy and thatâ€™s why it didnâ€™t work out. Also not sure what hbs gigs being from
cj have to do with it when 99% of them are mcing and heâ€™s a better mc then all
the yhz ðŸ˜­like?</p>
