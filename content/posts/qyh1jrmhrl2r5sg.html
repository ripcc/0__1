      <p>due to the audacity of even showing his bedroom and kitchen which is like
nothing the other members have i have to wonder if they&#x27;re actually gonna be
open about him living on his own, pretend like nothing even happened and not
mention his &#x27;roommates&#x27; or they&#x27;re gonna continue to push that rk and mt live in
the same dorm as him even though we can see the material LMAO</p>
