      <p>Forgot if it was the same admin, but there was one that was invited to an event
with ZgH, and she later boasted she had spoken to (read: cornered) him and told
him about what the fans want (read: schizobabble) and they&#x27;ll support him in
what he does (read: what they THINK/HOPE he does). Apparently ZgH was quite
spooked after that encounter.



Talking abt schizobabble another thing they do quite well to deflect from their
wrongdoings is to go &quot;oh the ledgers? Oh yeah we&#x27;ll post it soon.....SEE LOOK AT
ZGH POOR THING THOSE 8BACKS ARE BULLYING HIM AGAIN!&quot; those &quot;schizobabble&quot; I&#x27;ve
personally thought they use these deliberately to drum up negative sentiment to
goad the fans into thinking he&#x27;s alone and only have them so they buy and buy
and buy.</p>
