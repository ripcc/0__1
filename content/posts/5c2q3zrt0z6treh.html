      <p>pretty sure she was brought up briefly in that whole yg n word leak mess a few
days ago and she had to have seen that like and she put out that lil apology
tweet in the past, i remember people werenâ€™t stanning her at debut and that
person yelling on voice chat at a stage for her to apologise ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ maybe
thereâ€™s nothing going on up there and she didnâ€™t make the connection idkâ€¦..
