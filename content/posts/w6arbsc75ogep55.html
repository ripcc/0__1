      <p>i wonder what post-disbandment is gonna be like with member perceptions bc i
know with w1 i think w4nnables hate j43hwan, especially with that drama with him
claiming j1nyoung was being bullied by c1x but idk if they felt/expressed this
during the group&#x27;s run, there&#x27;s probably similar with exwon, i don&#x27;t think the
produce ggs have really experienced that so i think it&#x27;s a bg fanbase thing ðŸ˜­
like who are zroses gonna still rock with, who will they drop (this is more like
w1zones since none of them gaf about the j members minus s4kura and then i don&#x27;t
think they really care about the non-le ss3rafim/1ve members now that i think
about it other than like y3na? i&#x27;d say tr is gonna fall into this but i wonder
if other members will) and are they gonna admit to secretly hating members bc i
had a vision of this happening with jw the day right after disbandment, like
everyone just airing their grievances out LMAO</p>

      <p><p>their words not mine but he didn&apos;t wanna be in the group at all playm forced him to go on pdx (he&apos;s a vikton member) and he made it but he wanted to be in his group still. they said he&apos;s the reason they disbanded he was salivating for it and ruined the group ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he was the oldest being 94 and most of the group was 99 and under mind you it&apos;s 2019 so they were young. he still wasn&apos;t as deadbeaty as unc he grew to form relationships w them but yea that&apos;s ab it </p></p>
